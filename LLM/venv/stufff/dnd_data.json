It was historically one of the most prosperous countries of  . \n As of  , the country was under threat from all sides and struggling to hold onto order. Nobles bickered over land rights,   merchants and a   cell tried to gain a trading foothold, and there was a   presence. The   and the ruins of   both posed a threat. \n Around 1372 DR, the country felt the effects of the   and the death of King  . Bandits inhabited the roads and remnants of   and   armies inhabited the forests. The town of   was destroyed in a battle against the  , leaving the strategically important northeast of the country open to raiders wishing to invade. \n The ruler as of 1372 DR, Regent  , had her hands full dealing with all of these threats. She had the experienced   and   at her disposal. \n As of 1486 DR, Queen   ruled the country and focused on rebuilding after the past few years of war. \n Adventuring was frowned upon without an official license, but adventurers could likely lend a tremendous amount of aid to the overstretched Cormyrian military. Lady Alusair was known to offer land in exchange for services rendered to her country, so this was a place adventurers wanting to make a name for themselves tended to flock to. \n Cormyr was founded in the  . Its first king was  , son of   and  .  The kingdom was initially formed because the elves and humans in the region needed to get along with each other. Since that time, Cormyr grew by absorbing the realms of   and   and claiming the   as its own. \n Some time between   and  , Cormyr was invaded by many dragons, including  , the Purple Dragon, so-called because his scales went purple with age, who laid waste to virtually all of the settlements in the country. It was then raided by   from the  , who occupied the   until they were finally driven out in the  , by King  . By the  , many noble families had left Cormyr for either the   or  , or split into small factional bands. The city of   was sold to   and his pirates by a traitor to the crown around this time,  and it was after Magrath's death that the Purple Dragon was adopted as the nation's official symbol. \n In the  ,  , also known as \"The Usurper King\" and \"The Lost King\", attempted to establish a separate kingdom centred on the city of  . He was overthrown, after only eight days in power, by an allied army composed of forces from  ,  , and  , along with the  , led by King  . \n The   begun by the elf-dragon   did significant damage to the kingdom, resulting in the deaths of King   and his heir,   in  .  This began the Steel Regency of  , until Tanalasta's newborn son   could take the throne. \n The   did not spare Cormyr, but it survived relatively unharmed, save for the loss of a third of its  .  The   were not so kind to all its neighbours, and many would join the budding empire as Cormyr reluctantly grew to counter the   vassal-state of  .  Tensions between Cormyr and its neighbors   and   were constant, further fueled by the assassinations of Cormyrean royalty. \n Between   and   Cormyr fought a war on two fronts as it mustered troops to defend the Dalelands against Sembia's invasion and its own borders were invaded by Netheril.  King   was killed during the Siege of   and was succeeded by his daughter Queen  .  By the end of the war Cormyr had successfully reclaimed its land from the Sembian and Netherese forces and turned its focus to recovery. \n Cormyr was a hereditary monarchy, having followed that government type since its foundation at around 26 DR  The royalty and monarchy was synonymous with  , who held the throne in an unbroken line of succession since its establishment. Although, around 1370 DR there was some sentiment that the nation should be run by a council. .\n The royal court was the nation\u2019s center of power, and was located in the nation\u2019s capital,  . The king governed the nation at large through the fealty the landed nobility owned to him, and by the appointment of local lords. Nobles held government and courtly positions, as well as lands and noble titles. They served a variety of function\u2019s, and their main responsibility was to enact the monarch\u2019s visions and goals for the country\u2019s rulership.    \n Local government was often overseen by local lords, which were appointed representatives of the crown for the administration of towns, groups of towns and villages. The main functions of these local lords was collecting taxes and tithes, peacekeeping and dispensing the king\u2019s justice, as well as defending farmland and serving as the eyes and ears of the monarchy. Lords were allowed up to 40 men-at-arms and 6 guides, who were mostly  , and could be used as a town guard. Lords also had assistants, who held public office through the title of herald. Also referred to as king\u2019s heralds, they were trained clerks and record keepers. \n Inside the royal court, noble courtiers received various internal duties from the monarch. Key advisory positions were the most coveted, as they provided the chance of having the crown\u2019s ear and influencing policy.   Among these titles, one of the most prestigious was the Sage Most Learned of the Royal Court, or simply the  . In the 14th century DR, this office was held by  , and by 1479 DR, would be held by  .   .\n The ruling monarch had another advisor, who had the title of High Wizard, also known as the Royal Magician (among other titles), and who was in charge of the  . . Though they were separate organizations, the War Wizards were seen as synonymous with another group known as the  , who advised Cormyr\u2019s rulers on matters related to magic, and wrote the kingdom\u2019s laws regarding magical incidents in the Forest Kingdom.  . \n By  , the following laws had been posted at all major entry points to Cormyr. \n Apart from acting as part of Cormyr's military, the   and local militias, as well as the  , acted as the kingdom's law enforcement. The purple dragons in particular were seen as enforcers of the \"royal word\". .  \n In the 15th century DR,   put in place the  , which reformed Cormyrian law. Among other provisions, the Writ limited the powers of the nobility and granted inalienable rights to commoners, such as the right to a trial by jury. \n Cormyte society was divided between commoners, the military, and the ruling class. The last one was in turn was divided between the monarchy and the nobility .\n ~ \nKing/Queen \nPrince/Princess \nDuke/Duchess \nMarchion/Marchioness \nEarl/Countess \nViscount/Viscountess \nBaron/Baroness \nBaronet/Baronetess \nKnight\n \n The nobility of Cormyr were composed of the most wealthy and influential households. There was an annual ceremony at the beginning of the summer where each noble house came to   to meet and see the monarch and discuss their achievements over the previous year, before retiring to their summer residences. . By the 15th Century DR, there were two dozen major noble houses, and an oscillating number of more obscure ones. Nobles were born, not made, but there were exceptions in the form of local lords.   \n Local lords, appointed to govern localities in the name of the crown, were a subclass in relation to the Cormyrean noble houses, referred to as the \"landed nobility\" in order to distinguish the two. While it was true that people appointed as local lords were commonly members of the noble houses, that wasn't necessarily the case. The crown could appoint a notable commoner, who has either distinguished himself or been recommended by the townspeople, or someone who is the default ruler of a particular place by their personal influence alone. However, because local lords must be nobles, the appointment of a commoner serves to ennoble the individual, who is granted a noble title (if they didn't already have one).   was an example of this, after being named king's lord of Arabel. \n The landed nobility generally had positive relations with local lords, but many noble houses treat the crown's appointed servants as mere lackeys, involved with the petty affairs of commoners. \n Cormyr's laws were explicitly written to reflect that the noble houses enjoyed their lands and titles at the \"favor of the crown\", meaning a family could lose their lands and titles if they were disloyal to the nation, as was case with  , and for a time,  . \n Among the major noble families, three were particularly distinguished, sharing the label of \"royal houses\" with the   themselves. These were  ,  , and  , and are considered to be royal due to their historic blood ties to Cormyr's royal line, as they are descended from the silver brothers, whose offspring married into the Obarskyr dynasty.  However, by 1368 DR there was a law that only someone with Obarskyr blood could take the throne .\n Nobles swore allegiance to the crown on the sword  .  Nobles owed the king of Cormyr a certain number of troops, in lieu of their military service, under Cormyrian law. \n The nobility of Cormyr were fond of playing board games and were known to keep gaming tables in the parlors of their homes. .\n In Cormyte society, everyone who wasn't from a noble family or a local lord was considered a commoner. Commoners were divided between farmers, crafters and merchants. Commoners also filled most of the ranks of the   and the militias .\n Farmers were the foundation of the kingdom's conservative society, and farming was Cormyr's largest occupation. They mostly lived simple lives in land quite a distance from towns. Cormyrian farmers tended to have a strong sense of unity amongst themselves, more so then compared to most places. They also tended to be loyal to the Crown and the monarch, having promptly volunteered to join the military in times of crisis, such and when Gondengal threatened to break the realm apart and during the conflicts against Netheril and Sembia in the 15th century DR .\n There has never been serfdom in Cormyr. Its farmers were all citizens, who either independently owned the land they cultivated, or were landless crofters (the norm in upland Cormyr) who farmed land owned by someone else while paying rent, through either coin or a yield share. These landless farmers were in no way bound to the land, and could move if they wished .\n Cormyr's crafters also had a long reputation and tradition, and were respected for being blessed by the gods with the ability to transform materials into goods, either useful or decorative, ideally both. This group encompassed all kinds of artisans and builders, with different towns and cities being a centre for a particular type of craft. Unlike in other regions, crafter guilds were not particularly powerful, and resembled fraternal organizations. The concept of labor unions was mostly unknown in Cormyr. The exceptions to these rules were certain guilds of constructors that had discovered they could exert quite a bit of political influence by the 14th century DR .\n Finally, merchants were the most powerful social class outside the nobility. This group had became quite powerful, and their riches surpass even that of some noble families. Merchant influence was usually seen when a merchant house saved a noble family from financial trouble in exchange for behind-the-scenes control of a government post held by such nobles. Despite their power, the merchant class almost always maintained the interests of the nation and of the royalty above their own. This loyalty was due in part to the favorable mercantile conditions maintained by Cormyr's rulers . Their political influence grew steadily by the 15th century DR  .  \n After around  , coins in Cormyr were minted in either the   in   or the mint in  . Older coins existed that were minted in the   but these were not minted in the 14th century DR. \n By around  , Cormyrian coins bore the visage of  . They aged well and were made of pure metals with good weight. Coins were designated in regards to the   that produced them by their mint mark. The marks were a three-decker, four-masted carrack for the mint in Suzail and two parallel crescent moons for the one in High Horn . \n Coins were referred to by the following names :\n Cormyr's contact with other regions of   happened primarily through the activities of powerful and wealthy merchant organizations. The most powerful of which were, as of  , the  , the  , as well as the   and   trading families .\n Cormyr in 1479 DR. Often referred to as the \"Forest Kingdom\", Cormyr was once covered in thick forests. Due to commercial logging and clearing for farming, however, the once-great forests became restricted to the   in the west, the   in the east, and the relatively small   to the south between Wheloon and the  . The Dragonmere, an expanse of water connected to the  , bordered Cormyr to the south. The   mountains formed a boundary to the north and west of Cormyr, with the   to the east.  The   separated Cormyr from   in the southeast.  The   was a large lake in the middle of Cormyr. Cormyr itself was dotted with beacon towers, used to quickly relay messages across the land. \n As a key power in Faerun, whose domain was originally built from a much wilder land, Cormyr has had to defend its security and borders from threats throughout its history.  To that end, as well as to maintain royal authority in the realm, Cormyr has maintained a powerful military which it has been known for. The military is comprised of a professional standing army, as well as other military forces such as the local militias.      \n In regards to their standing military, the crown has historically divided its military between an army, a navy and the  . Due to their centralized hold on power, the Obarskyrs have generally preferred to disallow religious armies and large forces of mercenaries in the kingdom.    \n The   were the main standing force of Cormyr, whose name and banner coincided with Cormyr's crest. They were a large professional army, composed of highly trained, skilled, and loyal warriors, garrisoned in major cities and fortifications. The Purple Dragons were royal soldiers, sworn to the crown and the monarch. In the 14th century DR, the Dragons numbered at more then 12.000 soldiers.    \n They were trained warriors, having been known to be armored men-at-arms, guards, archers, as well as acting as horsemen and even hippogriff riders.  No matter their role, they were trained to work as a cohesive unit.  In the 15th century DR, they were divided into companies. \n Special among the army were the similarly named  , a group so heroic that the reputation of the entire institution was deserved partly due to their exploits. These were leaders and high ranking officers among the Purple Dragon, regarded for their leadership,  and skill. A Purple Dragon Knight could command from ten to over a hundred regular Purple Dragons. Being included in their ranks was a great honor, and promotion into knighthood was only granted to an exceptional few.  \n The navy of Cormyr was called the  .\n Cormyr's official naval vessels were all named after Cormyrian monarchs, such as   (after  ) and  , whereas the corsairs and privateers used vessel named for the weapons possessed by these rulers, such as   and  . \n The Heartlands consisted of the   and the surrounding lands, home to the oldest cities in Cormyr and innumerable smaller settlements. It was bounded by the foothills of the   and the shores of the   and  . It included  ,  , and  , making it the most urbanised and densely populated region of Cormyr. \n The Coast was a broad term that referred to the pastoral and long-settled coastal lands east of the  , along the   up to the border of   at the   and  . It largely consisted of rolling plains and small villages, punctuated by the large town of   and the forest of the  . \n The East Reaches of Cormyr were the great frontier of wilderness that lay to its east and north. It was made up of all the lands between the   and the  , as well as the lands north of Arabel as far as the   and  . The   sat in the center of this region, home of bandits, monsters, and ancient ruins. \n The West Reaches encompassed the western  , marked with perilous trails that linked the isolated villages and keeps, including the famous  . It was sparsely populated and considered the most dangerous region of Cormyr, thanks to the constant threat of brigands, monsters, and violent weather. Further west, the reaches claimed the  ,   and  , though the control was tenuous at best. \n Cormyr sent   and adventurers into neighboring regions to claim new land, clear out monsters and bandits, and further the interests of the Crown. The realm's control of these lands was tenuous at best, if it were ever achieved in the first place. This claimed territory included the Stonelands,  , and  , as well as other distant parts of the east and west reaches. \n The   fell under Cormyr's control following the   when the city-states there pleaded for assistance during the  . In this time,  ,  ,  ,  , and   joined Cormyr by various means. \n During the 15  century  , Cormyr struggled militarily and politically with   and  .

This was a large stone house with a porch running all along the front, with a plaque in the shape of a wooden shield by the door bearing Tessaril's name and title. It contained a number of comfortable guest rooms and a cupola that Tessaril enjoyed using as a lookout over her village. The house was home to Tessaril, her Herald Tzin Tzummer, and four Purple Dragons who served as guards and bodyguards. \n Tessaril was an old friend and lover of King  . Some Cormyreans wondered if they were too close, given their prior relationship, but were assured that they were just good friends following his marriage, their relationship entirely platonic. The king often stopped by Eveningstar in disguise when he wanted a drink at the   and to meet his people in secret. Occasionally, he dropped his disguise to dance with Tessaril at The Low Lantern.  Lord Tessaril was entirely loyal to King Azoun IV. \n She was aided in her lordly duties by her  ,  , and the town clerk and purser,  .  She also commanded the local contingent of  .  She could magically summon the services of   like   and   to aid in keeping the peace, maintaining the safety of the village, and in dealing with criminals. \n The villagers of Eveningstar loved their Lord Tessaril, and she knew it. Some of the men had more romantic interests, and would fight and die for her.  She was good friends with  , proprietor of The Lonesome Tankard. \n Tessaril kept a   as a  .  This winged cat, named Firespark, accompanied her often, either perched upon her shoulder and circling her feet with many purrs.  The tressym served as her unofficial food taster, insisting on sampling everything she ate and drank, which saved Tessaril from poisoning no less than six times. \n As lord of Eveningstar, Tessaril Winter was known as a good ruler,  being both swift and efficient about her duties to the crown.  She earned a reputation as one of the nicer lords of Cormyr, gently and attentively managing her domain.  In fact, she kept the peace through constant surveillance by   spells. \n Tessaril typically held court in  , but sometimes from in the village's Market Square, in the taproom of The Lonesome Tankard, and even on the front porch of her home, as she had the need. She invited those with concerns or complaints to speak openly and plainly, rather than let issues simmer in silence.  Through her judgments, she exercised the king's will and the laws of the realm.  Tessaril employed   to question murder victims, and   to question suspicious visitors in the Tankard (with proprietor Dunman's aid to render them asleep or inebriated). She would also use   to induce someone to confess a crime, to choose not to commit a crime or seek revenge, to leave town, and so on.  Tessaril only allowed temporary shrines to be erected in the village market for up to three days, from the first dawn to the last sunset. \n In her free time, she liked to use her magic to help or entertain children. She also enjoyed dancing in the evenings, often with the men of the village, who were smitten by her. \n Being a former adventurer herself, Tessaril was friendly to adventurers and gave them aid whenever possible, and the benefit of the doubt. However, she still watched closely all adventurers in her lands, knowing full well the trouble they could get into.  In particular, she was fascinated by the nearby   and believed there was still treasure to be found within. She regularly used the   to assist explorers of the Halls. However, she rationed this out, only healing a group once or twice. \n Operating under the name \"Tessar the Mage\", and disguised as a man, she was formerly a member of the   adventuring band. She gained some local fame in this role.  She was also once a lover of King   of Cormyr, some time prior to his wedding. \n So she could better serve her beloved village and king, Tessaril retired from the adventuring career, and from the path of a mighty mage.

Alusair led Cormyr as its regent for her infant nephew,  . \n Some of the major concerns of her reign were rebuilding Cormyr and reclaiming the realm's status as the leading power in the region. As regent, she tried to keep Cormyr fully independent, by fighting attempts to influence her country's policy and economy made by agents of its neighbors,   and  . She was advised by  , apprentice to  , who advised Alusair's father. \n Her full name was \"Alusair Nacacia Obarskyr\".  Her father Azoun nicknamed her \"Allie\". \n    of Earthfast called her the \"Mithril Princess\" after the   armor his   crafted for her.  This title stuck with her for the next decade.  The young noble-born knights whom Alusair rode with eventually dubbed her the \"Steel Princess\", however, in admiration of her spirit and her skill in battle. \n When she became regent of Cormyr, she was named the \"Steel Regent\". \n At about the age of 19, Alusair was short and slender, with dark eyes. The   diplomat   described her as \"impish\" and \"winsomely beautiful\" after a court visit in  . \n Aged around 22, Alusair was of medium height at 5 feet 6 inches (1.67 meters), and she weighed 150 pounds (68 kilograms). She had blond hair, and some reported her eyes as blue. \n By the age of 25, after four years of hard adventuring, Alusair had changed noticeably, acquiring an athletic build at the same height. Now she possessed a mature beauty with wrinkles at the corners of her eyes.  She had deep oak-brown eyes  and black eyebrows,  yet her hair was long and golden,  though this later turned ash-blond. \n Alusair was known to have heated political arguments with her father, which would end in broken plates and goblets.  She had no desire to be the queen of Cormyr.  The Steel Regent, as a follower of Torm, was known to consider several Torm-worshiping   close friends. \n \n Alusair Nacacia Obarskyr was the daughter of King   and Queen   of the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr.  One night in  , Azoun had met the famed   and     and spent the evening with her lying on the rooftop at the back of the palace, talking and swapping a flask of good  . His courtiers discovered him and brought the pair back, as Filfaeril had grown alarmed at Azoun's disappearance. Fortunately, Storm calmed Filfaeril with her charm and even played her harp for husband and wife in the royal bedchambers, late in the night, setting a romantic mood that Filfaeril believed led to the conception of their daughter.  Alusair was born on   in the  .  She was their youngest child, born a year after her sister  , and three years after her brother  , who died as an infant. \n In her early years, she apparently led the life of a typical Obarskyr princess, receiving a formal education and undergoing training in courtly activities, including etiquette but also riding and martial skills.  She was tutored by the Royal Magician,  .  She learned some military strategy from her father  and spent much time with the castle falconers, learning about raptors like  ,  , and  . She even helped the hawkmaster to a train a young black hawk. \n Alusair grew to be a rebellious and impulsive tomboy, hot-tempered and headstrong.  As the younger daughter, she wasn't set to rule. Furthermore, she had no interest in being queen anyway, nor in politics. Azoun and Filfaeril were too distracted by the kingdom's affairs, and Tanalasta by fashion, and Alusair felt she didn't belong in the royal court.  She revolted against courtly etiquette and the expectations placed upon her.  Instead, inspired by her father's stories of adventuring with the   under the name \"Balin the Cavalier\", she wanted to leave and see the world. But her father the king struggled to instill in her a sense of duty to the nation, wishing to curb her desire to wander in favor of a life at court. He pressed her to give up her plans, and the equally headstrong father and daughter clashed. Something had to give. \n Finally, at the age of 21, Alusair could not bear life in the royal court anymore and determined to make her own way.  Matters came to a head in the  , when her parents arranged a marriage between her and a member of the   family of  .  In early spring, she left a note for her family explaining her reasons, took some money, and fled the court and Suzail for a life of adventure.  By the summer, stories of the princess's disappearance had spread across  . Her reasons and destination were not made known to the public, but it was rumored she had run away. \n Alusair's flight left her parents deeply hurt, and Azoun rightfully blamed himself.  He offered an impressive reward for her safe return: 12,000   and a knighthood\u2014a princess's ransom.  However, he did not consider the danger this put her in, as bounty hunters began to stalk the runaway princess. Alusair naturally did not want to be captured and ransomed back, nor to be held captive to extort the royal family. At some point, she threw her   into the sea, so no one could identify her as a princess of House Obarskyr. \n Within the month, Alusair was sighted in  , an independent town on Cormyr's border being besieged by   and  . By   of 1356 DR, a Cormyrean army was sent to occupy  \u2014their exact purpose was unclear, but later it was rumored their primary goal was actually to retrieve their renegade princess rather than relieve the town. By  , they had massacred the orcs and occupied the Gap, and Cormyr then annexed the town.  By the month of  , the middle of summer, word of Alusair's runaway and presence in Tilverton had spread far and wide. However, for all this, the army failed to find Alusair. \n In fact, she had an ally in the form of  , a priest of   and the   ruler of Tilverton before the occupation. That occupation saw all of Gharri's powers and responsibilities taken away in all but name, leaving him with the meaningless title of Lord Regent. After a few months, Gharri chose to quietly leave Tilverton, and Alusair ran off with him, with the pair heading into the wild north country. The priest's magic kept them safe during this period of intense searching. Alusair traveled with Gharri for some months and they had a heated love affair. However, their passion cooled and ended in a fight that saw them separate. \n Supported by the  , Gharri relocated to  , a ruined fortress in  , and from there he managed the local clergy of Gond, as well as a network of spies.  Finally, in 1356 DR, Gharri traveled to   to assist Lord  , and was slain near   in a massive magical battle with a dozen   mages, but his death was not widely known.  Alusair later told Azoun that Gharri was killed while they tried to escape bounty hunters seeking the reward.  His death steeled Alusair's resolve to not return home. For years after, she blamed her father for Gharri's death, but ultimately decided he could not have expected how the bounty hunters would behave. \n Alusair, meanwhile, largely drifted.  She'd been living on the money she took when she fled the palace, but when this ran out,  she was forced to steal to survive. She quickly grew skilled at thievery, and even prospered. No longer a sheltered princess, she became a streetwise operator.  Alusair spent a season or two searching for the famed  , as many adventurers had done, both good and bad.  In fact, she may have fallen victim to the so-called Curse of the Ring, according to  : it was said that whoever sought for the   would suffer the death of a loved one. It was only a few days after Alusair decided to seek the Ring that Gharri was slain.  Alusair later took work as a caravan guard and mercenary adventurer, but always made certain she agreed with the goals of her employers, and that she fought for good causes. At one point, she helped a fishing village make a deal with a  . \n At one point, she went to   in  , on the other side of the  .  There, she brought from a mage a  , which shielded her against magical detection\u2014especially from the   of Cormyr,  , and her father's own wizards. \n Her travels also took her to   on the  ,  and she was supposedly sighted there in early   of the  . Stories told that she was living as an adventurer and was a companion of a powerful mage of the city, but didn't say which. It was reported that in a Waterdhavian tavern, one man boasted that he knew and moments later was discovered turned to stone, which then spontaneously shattered.  North of Waterdeep, Alusair said she was traveling alone when she was captured by a band of  .  She also said she visited the   and  . \n Meanwhile, the runaway princess continued to be hunted all over the Realms, and the reward remained on offer. By   of 1357 DR, the royal court of Cormyr was receiving reports of sightings all over Faer\u00fbn, from all points of the compass. Some even placed her in lands only known as legends in Cormyr, so many were treated as false.  Outrageous and colorful stories flourished about Alusair's whereabouts and deeds.  One story even held she'd been seen in  , sailing with pirates from the  . \n Eventually, however, the thieves' guild of   put a price on Alusair's head and for this reason alone she returned to Cormyr, intending to reunite with her family and return to the safety of the court.  She journeyed back to Tilverton; sightings reported to the crown put her in the area, before she disappeared again.  In fact, she was captured by the   and held in a cell in their hideout in Tilverton.  Azoun sent out envoys like   with orders to hire adventurers to locate Alusair.  Azoun himself came to Tilverton, ostensibly for a defense treaty, but was rumored to be seeking Alusair.  In fact, the Fire Knives were using Alusair as bait, to first lure the king to Tilverton and then for a trap to assassinate him\u2014a fact very clear to all involved.  Ultimately, in   of 1357 DR,  Rastafan's hired adventurers raided the hideout; the proactive princess aided her own rescue and took up a weapon for the fight. Vengeful, she was intent on slaying  , leader of the Fire Knives who'd imprisoned her. \n In the  , the   erupted onto the Realms. Many rumors circulated about Alusair's activities in this tumultuous time. In early  , in  , it was being rumored that Alusair had been sighted a number of times in the  , riding swiftly with sword sheathed over her back. Or merchants said they'd seen her with a bloody sword and striding through  's ruins. Or folk claimed that on horseback she had chased a man down in the streets of  , a city in  . \n Living by the sword, she matured into a confident, strong-willed, and independent young woman, fierce in her beliefs about right and wrong and ready to defend them at the point of a blade. Alusair felt that rulers like her father were unable to care for ordinary people, that their laws took away freedoms. She believed that she could do more good for Cormyr and the Realms with a sword in her hand than she could stuck at court with nobles, a life she had little patience for anyway. She did not want to be responsible for the lives of other people, only her own. She was also reluctant to quit her adventuring, having seen Azoun's own regret at settling down. \n Alusair, Azoun IV, and Vangerdahast consult prior to battle with the Tuigan Horde. Finally, in mid-autumn of the  , Alusair came to the   in the Vast, seeking a lost artifact (though friends said she was \"hiding out\" ) but finding  , a beleaguered   city under constant siege by   and  . Seeing a good cause to fight for, Alusair lent her aid to the defense. The fighting was constant and bloody, but Alusair proved her battle prowess.  After one battle with goblins, the dwarves honored Alusair by forging for her a suit of their precious and legendarily strong    , sized for a human and fashioned from the finest   steel.     dubbed her \"the Mithril Princess\". \n Here, too, Alusair was the subject of much rumor and speculation, though for once her name was not attached. Traders dealing with the dwarves told of a mysterious warrior fighting beside them, a human woman with a fiery temper and regal bearing. Some thought she was a renegade   of  ; others that she was one of the  , driven from the   by the Zhentarim. A few expected she was a minor ruler or courtesan from a southern land. Even the missing pirate queen   was proposed. The sage   of Shadowdale hinted that the truth would soon be revealed.  However, Alusair did not reveal her true identity to the dwarves. \n Alusair grew to respect the dwarves of Earthfast and treated them as comrades in arms.  She befriended the dwarf    , who said Alusair could tell a good story.  She grew familiar with the ways of Earthfast dwarves, learned their military practices and tactics, and came to speak and understand   perfectly. Equally, she became experienced in fighting orcs.  In return, she shared her own knowledge of military strategy  and introduced Torg to the use of  , particularly recommending a treatise written by her father, Azoun. Torg began training his soldiers in their use.  Torg described Alusair as a \"brilliant human general\".  Thus, after many battles and new strategies, together they routed the orcs and saved Earthfast. \n Alusair stayed with the Earthfast dwarves for some nine months.  In   in the  , Ironlord Torg was the first to respond via letter to King Azoun's call for a crusade against the advancing  .  Alusair accompanied the dwarves (including Morgalla ) on the march to  , intending to finally reunite with her father. She'd decided it was time to forget the past and hoped he would at last accept her for who she was rather than what he wanted her to be.  Alusair did not tell Torg she was Azoun's daughter until it was too late for him to contact her father about it. \n She was re-united with her father during that campaign and earned a lot of respect when she temporarily took over her father's army and later personally captured and broke  's standard. \n \n Following the battle, Alusair left again, intending to settle some debts and keep some promises. First, she had to return what she'd been lent by the   of the   for the battle. However, she expected to return to Suzail in a few months, before winter at the end of 1360 DR. She and her father parted in peace and mutual respect, and she kept a royal signet ring with which she could be located.  After four years, Alusair had had many adventures, and returned to the Cormyrean court wiser in the ways of the world than many other adventurers, and certainly most princes or princesses. \n Now based at the royal court in Suzail, Alusair worked with Azoun and Vangerdahast on a number of royal affairs and conducting various missions for the crown, ranging from serving as a diplomatic envoy to activities more suited to her past as an adventurer.  Back at court, she aided her father when he went in disguise among the commoners to hear their views, by clearing his schedule and making cover stories. \nHowever, she spent the majority of her time riding around Cormyr, its backlands, and the desolate  , battling outlaws and monsters. She was accompanied by a band of young male noble knights, nicknamed her \"Blades\"; some were heirs, some youngest sons. Notoriously, she often took them as lovers.  But in admiration of her spirit and skill in combat, they named her the Steel Princess.  Once in her adventures, she was surprised by bandits and fought them off, only half-dressed and splattered with blood; Vangerdahast inadvertently   on her at this time. \n Having proved her valor and prowess in the war, Alusair won the love and respect of both the people and the  , Cormyr's elite military. In their eyes, she was second only to her father the king. Many came to see her as a future commander of the Purple Dragons and of the whole realm.  In time, she became a   herself.  She was a much-liked war-leader, but the elder nobles openly disapproved of her wildness,   fearing that, as a queen, she would be aggressive and hotheaded when facing threats\u2014real and perceived\u2014to the realm.  Others thought she used her role as a warrior to avoid taking the role of ruler. \n During this time, Alusair authored  . \n In 1367 DR, Princess Alusair joined her family in attending a celebration held by Lord   at his manor,  , to celebrate King Azoun IV's birthday, along with numerous other dignitaries. \n During these days, Alusair suffered a number of would-be suitors. Before  , the young and shifty noble   attempted to romance Tanalasta, who rejected him, then he immediately switched his attentions to Alusair, who'd heard all about him and his lines from Tanalasta and hurled him through a window. Martin dislocated his shoulder against a table on the other side, and thereafter claimed he'd suffered it in a barroom brawl, which wasn't far from the truth.  In the late 1360s  , Alusair turned down a proposal for marriage from the minor lord   of  . For this, the murderous megalomaniac would seek her death and the throne for himself. \n In the  , Alusair was operating in the Stonelands again, commanding a troop of twenty-four young noble knights, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . They were pursuing a bold   band that had raided a caravan east of  ; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a  , a \" \", and three  . Meanwhile, the   had erupted and Azoun lay dying in Suzail. Alusair and her knights were on a high meadow north of   when she received a   delivered by  , informing her of the situation and warning her to stay in the Stonelands for the duration of the emergency. Setting aside her grief, Alusair returned to find Beldred and the knights had impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. She rallied her forces to defeat the orcs, before deducing they served a   and the  , who had been charming and transporting monsters into the area. Alusair, Beldred, Brace, and Threldryn together slew the naga, with the princess blinding it and destroying the   before it could disgorge another monster. Alusair resolved to seek out the other gates rather than return to Suzail.  Shielded against detection, even the   couldn't locate her,  and she was reported to have led her troop deeper into the Stonelands  in order to avoid a patrol from   sent to contact her.  Rumors flourished in her absence; some even whispered Alusair and her Blades had stolen into the city to murder in their beds disloyal nobles who'd supported Vangerdahast becoming regent. \n After a long peace, however, the new decade saw calamity after calamity befall Cormyr. First, in the  , a blight struck the land and then the    , an ancient foe of the Obarskyrs, sent the   and the   to assault the kingdom. In the  , King Azoun IV and Steel Princess Alusair fought to defend the realm, but Cormyr suffered many defeats. Worse, some nobles defied Crown Princess Tanalasta or committed treason, showing they'd had more loyalty to Azoun than the Crown. In the  , Nalavara herself entered the fray and Azoun died in battle slaying the Devil Dragon. Tanalasta defeated the ghazneths but soon after died in childbirth, but the child was saved\u2014the new infant king of Cormyr,  . Through Alusair's and all their efforts, Cormyr was saved, but at a terrible cost. \n With her father and older sister dead and her infant nephew too young to take the throne, only Alusair was left to rule Cormyr as regent until Azoun V was old enough to become king. Filfaeril, now Dowager Queen, named Alusair as regent, and the Steel Regency of Princess Alusair commenced in 1371 DR.  The Steel Regent inherited a kingdom in crisis: many of its soldiers, officials,  , and nobility, its greatest heroes, and two of the royal family had been slain, leaving only a newborn king  and a reluctant regent. Meanwhile, the realm had become much less politically stable, almost to the point of anarchy. Many Cormyreans, even many of the nobility and mercantile classes, doubted if Alusair was even fit to rule, and spoke openly. Her reputation as a wild and lusty warrior princess, which had once won her admiration, was now used against her. A fearful and uncertain populace waited to see what kind of ruler she would be: tyrannical, wanton, headstrong, or perhaps just and wise. \n Naturally, Alusair dealt with these concerns in her own way\u2014by cutting right through. For example, on  , 1371 DR, Alusair rode though  , with High Knight   and a retinue of Purple Dragons and War Wizards, staying at the  . Arriving   crown, jewels, and shining armor, clad in only worn  , the Regent both awed and disappointed the villagers. Alusair told the innkeeper,  , of the death of her husband   in the war and consoled her, telling of her own grief for her father. Alusair then generously treated villagers and travelers to meals and drinks at the Crown's expense, prompting a nightlong revel. Near night's end, Alusair danced with a stableboy,  , trying to teach him courtly dancing and inspire him to come to Suzail and serve the realm. Yet the lad's father, the stablemaster  , an ex\u2013Purple Dragon, accused her of being a \"wanton slut\" unfit to sit the Dragon Throne. Alusair didn't deny it, and explained herself openly, calling for Andur to serve the realm again. When he refused, she challenged him to dance or fight, and the regent handily trounced him in a barroom brawl. A subdued, defeated Andur elected to serve. Alusair danced with him, then teased taking him to bed. \n Nevertheless, the kingdom was creeping with conspiracies among its nobles and its foes, with ambitious lords, zealous patriots, regency loyalists, enemy powers, and remnants of Nalavara's forces all vying for power, and the War Wizards monitored all to guard against treason.  Among the upstarts were the so-called  , a loose confederation of minor nobles and rich merchants who mistrusted the Steel Regent, fearing she would be a despot. Some felt they had the best interests of Cormyr at heart, but others worried that they would lose their wealth and positions. They were led by the villainous Lord Hyraken, who still held a grudge against the princess. The Freedom Warriors engaged in crime to discourage support of the regent.  Fortunately, Lady  , who was opposed to the Freedom Warriors, sent adventurers to recover the Devil Dragon Nalavara's hoard and, in the race, Hyraken and the Freedom Warrior's villainous leadership were slain. Lady Vaylan gifted half the hoard to Regent Alusair, who used this windfall in the rebuilding effort.  Nevertheless, Alusair had to carefully manage the nobility in order to retain the king's power.  The realm remained rife with intrigue. \n However, by the middle of the  , the Steel Regent had proved her talent for rule and her determination to preserve Cormyr.  Ruling from Suzail, Alusair made regular appearances with the young Azoun V, demonstrating she had no fears for herself, the boy king, or Cormyr, and to be accessible to the people. She also made the Purple Dragons and War Wizards an increasingly visible presence, both to give a sense of safety and to guard against trouble.  Working to rebuild national morale and military power, Alusair focused on reclaiming and resettling territory lost in the war, rebuilding farms, and replanting fields. She also staved off attempts by Sembian and   investors to gain control over Cormyrean lands and to influence their affairs. Still short on wealth and resources, Alusair turned to adventurers, having been one herself, to help restore order, but the nobility saw this as a weakness. She upheld her father's offer of a barony to any could bring civilization to the Stonelands. \n However, the first crisis of Alusair's reign came that year. The Regent was entertaining   emissaries of the  , consider their proposal of alliance, when   arrived on   bearing proof of Shadovar villainy. In order to make   fertile, they were melting the  , and cared nothing for flooding and starvation that would ensure across the  . Alusair expelled the emissaries and instead organized an alliance with   and others to assault Shade. The Royal Magician  , guided by Galaeron and  , established a base camp in the canyons beneath the floating city. Meanwhile, the Shadovar launched a counter-attack on Cormyr. Cormyrean defenders clashed with the Shade forces at   on  . In the battle, Vangerdahast launched a powerful magical weapon against the Shades, but this backfired, interacting unexpectedly with their   magic, utterly annihilating Tilverton and leaving only a shadow-filled crater. In the coming months, Alusair's alliance struggled to make any headway against the Shadovar or the   besieging Evereska. They were hampered by a lack of knowledge of Shadow Weave magic, and the continued melting of the High Ice disrupted the weather, economies, and food supplies of Cormyr and her allies. Finally, on  , the phaerimms infiltrated Alusair's war council and demonstrated their power, but then surprisingly offered a truce: if Cormyr abandoned its ally Evereska, then join the Cormyreans against Shade. Alusair naturally refused, but the phaerimms helped nonetheless. Ultimately, the alliance triumphed over Shade and phaerimm forces, with Evereska freed, the melting of the High Ice halted, and peace returned. However, Cormyr, still reeling from the Goblin War, now suffered drought, economic crisis, and the devastating loss of Tilverton. \n In spring of the  , Regent Alusair agreed with the demands of nobles and ordered that the Crown instead pay for construction and maintenance of bridges and culverts in the realm. She also ordered that officers of the Court oversee these and other public works (such as ensuring proper signage), in order to limit the possibility of dishonest nobles passing off work on their estates as bridge and culvert work. \n By late 1374 DR, bar conspirators speaking in secret, complaints against the Steel Regent had gone quiet. The people did not doubt her now, and she was widely held to be as good a ruler as her father had been\u2014better even, for she was more approachable, more loved, and more inspiring. The     published a chapbook,  , praising her at this time.  \n In winter of the  , the   broke, exposing corruption in the public works system Alusair had instituted in 1374 DR. Alusair reacted by increasing oversight (both overt and covert) of how tax money was spent. She also signed into law the existing practice of confiscating any properties acquired through misappropriated funds. Nobles and wealthy landowners alike were angered, but Alusair was resolute. This wiped out corruption, or at least shifted it to   fronts. \n The  , saw a   spy arrested in Suzail. Steel Regent Alusair hanged the spy in a public square, which triggered the  , a brief but heated conflict between Cormyr and the Shadovar. \n Finally, in the  , Azoun V was crowned at 13 years of age  after several nobles spurred him to insist that he take the crown. Six years later, during her mother's funeral, Alusair argued with her nephew and disappeared immediately afterward with no confirmed sightings made ever since. \n After Alusair's death, she continued her existence as a  , haunting and patrolling the haunted wing of the Royal Palace for decades. She was very nearly destroyed by   in the  , while attempting to aid   in defending the palace from would-be thieves. \n By 1479 DR, an ironclad warship in the Cormyrean navy was named the \" \" after Alusair. This was the only Cormyrean warship not named for a past monarch of the realm. \n The Steel Princess was renowned for her skill at arms, her prowess in battle, her mastery of  , and her strategic accomplishments, especially in raids and skirmishes. Less a diplomat, Alusair was a fine leader and Cormyr's greatest battlemaster. Possessed of great endurance and an indomitable will, she was accustomed to hard living in the wilderness and on the trail. \n In combat, Alusair favored entering melee over the use of ranged weapons, and relied on her skill and armor to win through.  She specialized in the   and was an expert in its use.  She was also proficient in the  ,  ,  , and medium  , and in the   and   for when she did fight at range.  In her early days as a thief, she was practiced in the  ,  ,  ,  , and  .  Alusair could fight with two weapons at once, if need be, and was highly capable in mounted combat.  She was also well versed in fighting orcs and knew their tactics. \n As a  , Alusair learned to make a powerful rallying cry to have her troops charge and to make inspirational speeches to instill courage and raise morale. She also trained to defend her comrades around her. \n Alusair was an expert rider, and she knew well how to handle horses and raptors, such as  ,  , and  . She knew wilderness lore; she could track well and make a camp. She was also a trained sailor. Alusair was fit and athletic, being good at climbing and leaping, and had keen senses. \n On the other hand, Alusair disliked the art of diplomacy and courtly life, and dealing with affairs and intrigues there. Although she knew her etiquette and diplomacy, her anger at it made her clear, cold, and precise. She could be very intimidating. \n Throughout her adventuring career, Alusair was typically armed with a  ,  , and a  .  Around 1369 DR, Alusair used a sword in combat, and kept another smaller court sword in her saddle when riding.  In her left boot, Alusair kept a   with a large blue-green jewel in the pommel, which acted as a ward against magical attacks from her enemies.  By 1372 DR, as Regent, Alusair wielded a  . \n In battle, she wore a full suit of    , fashioned from the finest   steel and of the famously strong dwarven-made  . The dwarves of Earthfast made it for Alusair in thanks for her aid in their battles, and it was one of the very few suits of the precious Earthfast armor sized for a human. \n By 1372 DR, Alusair carried a   that bore a purple dragon on a black field, the standard of the boy king Azoun V. \n As an adventurer, Alusair carried a standard set of adventuring equipment. \n Alusair possessed a  , which identified her as a princess of House Obarskyr. It also allowed the Royal Magician of Cormyr\u2014first Vangerdahast, and then Caladnei\u2014to know her location and communicate with her via telepathy.  However, after she ran away from the palace, she rid herself of the signet ring by dropping it into the sea to conceal her identity.  She received another when she returned to the court. \n She also owned a   (functioning like the amulet of the same name), which prevented others from   on her or magically detecting her location. She wore this only when necessary (or when she wished to remain undetected) because it blocked the powers of the signet ring.  This she brought from a mage in Ravens Bluff while a runaway, expressly to prevent Vangerdahast and his wizards from finding her. \n By 1372 DR, she also had a   and a  . \n Thanks to her position in the Cormyrean royal family, Alusair could access a wide range of magical items, in particular her father's extensive collection of magical swords. \n By 1369 DR, Alusair had a hollow metal sphere that, upon spoken command, could transform into a key to unlock a secret vault in the depths of the royal palace. It was one of only five, the others possessed by the king, queen, Vangerdahast, and Princess Tanalasta. \n Though she still rankled at court life when she returned and spent as much time as she could riding away from Suzail, she did settle into a political role, though she usually preferred to focus on military matters. \n Through the 1360s DR, accepting her role as princess, Alusair worked closely with King Azoun and the Royal Magician Vangerdahast, and undertook various missions for the crown. These ranged from serving as a diplomatic envoy to outright adventuring. She might act alone or with fellow adventurers, under her own name and title or in disguise. This work could take her around Cormyr, neighboring lands, and anywhere in the Realms. \n Her primary role however was patrolling Cormyr, especially its backlands and the Stonelands, with a band of young noble knights and combatting various outlaws,   and  , and assorted monsters. \n One of Alusair's unofficial duties was to cover for the king when he made secret excursions outside the palace in disguise to hear the common folk's views. Working with Vangerdahast, Alusair cleared Azoun's schedule of court business in concert with natural lulls in work, and put out stories that he was ill, had family matters to handle, or was otherwise unavailable. \n As regent, Alusair had a nigh-constant stream of intrigues and covert affairs to deal with. Like all members of the royal family, Alusair maintained a small network of personal spies, agents, and informants for covert activities. In fact, Alusair had two such groups. One set were recruited from her Blades, the young knights she once rode with, chosen mostly to feel important and impress their families. These were an obvious and amateurish bunch, intended to serve as a distraction and cover for the activities of her professional spies. These latter were people she'd worked with for years, ranging from lovers loyal only to her to   loyal to the realm, like  . She also attempted to persuade some   (an internal police force) of the   to report to her as well, as she feared rogue War Wizards allying with rebellious nobles. \n Following their deaths and retirements, Azoun's, Tanalasta's, and Vangerdahast's spies were all left without patrons but with many secrets. As regent, Alusair worked to identify these people, what they were now up to, and if they'd taken service with disloyal nobles or even with Caladnei. Alusair also understood that the   had served as spies for courtiers and members of the Obarskyr family for their own reasons (albeit preferring to keep the realm stable and at peace, and with the existing balance of power). \n Alusair enjoyed sparring with her Blades, the young nobles she once rode with and trusted well. These took the form of brief and brutal bouts of sword-play, in which the Steel Regent spent her rage and frustration at matters of court. \n In the 1360s DR, Alusair had a few trysts with lovers at the   royal hunting lodge in the  . \n Through the 1360s DR, Alusair was associated closely with a number of young male noble-born knights nicknamed her \"Blades\". These men had ridden with her on her missions around the realm and the Stonelands, and she trusted them.  Even as regent, the Blades remained as her sparring partners,  as lovers, and as one layer of her network of spies and agents.  These men dubbed her the Steel Princess in admiration,  but elder nobles openly disapproved of their intimacy and Alusair's wild ways.  It was widely rumored they were as much lovers of the lusty warrior princess as comrades-at-arms;  Gossips told that her monster-slaying missions were more likely weekend trysts at hidden royal hunting lodges, that she wished to try out all the noble bachelors before marriage,  that she would even kiss her horse if it trotted up to her, and so on and so on.  While there was some truth to her relationships with the Blades, her reputation seems wildly exaggerated.  In 1369 DR, she was attracted to  , one of her knights, until she learned he was most likely an illegitimate son of Azoun IV, and thus her own half-brother. Unable to have him as lover, husband, or brother, she accepted him as a close friend. \n As Regent, Alusair was advised and assisted by the Royal Magician  , who was also commander of the War Wizards of Cormyr.  The two both had strong opinions and high spirits, so they could talk directly and openly about the affairs of the realm. Although Caladnei was humble and preferred to operate in the background, Alusair nudged her increasingly to the fore while she took time away from court.  By 1374 DR, the two were described as best friends, and Caladnei did not try to control Alusair as Vangerdahast did Azoun. \n Alusair tried to become a closer friend to  , second-in-command of the War Wizards, in order to gain a better understanding of that organization and to more effectively manage the kingdom. \n Around 1360 DR, Alusair was not a member of the   and had no affiliation with it, but was high-minded enough that she might fit well with the group. Vangerdahast wondered if she might one day be drawn to the group, of which he was a valued ally.   , the one-time   agent, once met Alusair and wrote down her tales of her adventures before 1362 DR. \n Alusair authored a book on military matters and the Purple Dragons, titled  , published in  . \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Alusair_Obarskyr"},

He has written several dozen short stories,  well over a dozen novels, and contributed to over a score of sourcebooks set in the immensely-popular   campaign setting. \n Ed's earliest writings were made exclusively for his own entertainment, taking inspiration from authors such as  ,  ,  , and  , among others. Ed greatly appreciated a style of worldbuilding employed by  , in which each story in a series stood independently on its own, but contributed along with others to the lore of a rich, ever-expanding world. \n In Ed's original vision, the \"Forgotten Realms\" was one of several worlds\u2015along with the real-world  \u2014set in a multiverse of different, coexisting worlds. It was said that the myths and legends of Earth originated from the world of the Realms, but had been lost to humankind over many years. \n Ed held ambitions to fully detail the entirety of the Forgotten Realms, fleshing out every place in full detail. He has said that the reason the Realms became so popular was that it felt like living place, where readers could visit, fall in love with, and make a little bit their own.  He has admitted that it may be unrealistic to detail every part of his world,  but was excited by seeing fans take up the mantle and complete it for themselves. \n Ed was introduced to the concept of full-on roleplaying\u2015or \"ham acting\" as he called it, by a particularly inspirational friend named September.  This style of character portrayal was evident in several larger-than-life Realms characters, including   and his long-time nemesis  . \n According to Ed, his home campaigns have always featured three primary characteristics: \n In addition to creating Realmslore and authoring novels, Ed spends much of his time attending conventions and meeting fans.  He works as a library clerk and sometimes as a librarian, and has edited over a dozen small press magazines. \n Ed has expressed his delight as to how much deeper and more rich his fellow authors have made to the Realms. He noted specifically the contributions of long-time Realms authors  ,  ,  , and  , along with authors who later took on the mantle of shaping the Realms, including  ,  , and  . He also praised the  work of other game designers and freelance writers. \n Although Elminster is the in-world alter ego for Ed,  this was done for editorial purposes, as it was requested to him by TSR, Inc. However, Elminster is not a character that Ed himself would have picked as his alter ego if given the choice.  It is a common conceit in Ed's writing that the plane-travelling Elminster is a friend of his and that his knowledge of the Forgotten Realms comes from their chats. \n Ed Greenwood was born in 1959 and grew up in the suburbs of    .  He began to imagine and create the earliest iteration of the Forgotten Realms at the age of four.  While he did not yet know their names, his earliest imaginings of the Forgotten Realms featured   and  , two of his famous  . \n By 1965, Ed had written his first story set in the Realms, involving the wheezing swindler   and his adventures across the  . That story was published and distributed by his father to several work colleagues in September of 1966. \n In 1974 Ed began to work at a local library in Toronto Ontario. He has held numerous library clerk, and sometimes librarian, positions at various libraries in the Greater Toronto Area well into 2023. \n After discovering the   tabletop game in 1975,  Ed first incorporated the Forgotten Realms into the gaming system in his home game. By 1978 he and his friends were playing regular games together in an ongoing campaign.   While Ed's first campaign involved the   in  , Ed's most famous campaign revolved around the adventurers known as the  .  Ed's skill at including rich detail and creating a living, breathing world, created robust feelings of immersion for his players. \n In 1979, Ed began writing for  , offering pieces of Realmslore for fans to incorporate into their own home campaigns. Some time later Ed met  , game designer at  . Ed sent the folks at TSR several dozen boxes of notes and hand-drawn maps, and in 1986 the Forgotten Realms was purchased by the company outright.  In July of 1987 the 1  edition D&D   was published by TSR, authored by Jeff Grubb,  , and Ed Greenwood. \n Among Ed's favorite works are the   and  . \n Ed was regularly featured in the recurring Dragon magazine article  , in which Elminster of the Realms,   of the   setting, and   of  , gather together together to discuss the goings on of the multiverse. In just about every meeting, Ed is relegated to stuffing himself in a nearby suit of armor (to Elminster's amusement), so that he may discreetly observe and take mental notes. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ed_Greenwood"},

He was stocky, muscular, and physically fit for the man of his age who kept a rigorous exercise regimen. \n In his youth, Azoun was a rebel who cared nothing for boring politics and preferred adventuring with his friends. He often missed those days of no responsibilities and no weight of the crown. Even though Azoun remained an idealist, he would perform his duties and forge alliances when necessary. He punished criminals harshly but was a generous ruler and defender. \n Azoun was content to be in battle, and despite the risks to himself, would not allow himself to be excluded from any combat that might arise in his presence.  Although, being ready and eager, Azoun was an experienced and talented tactician who was using the troops, their skills, enemies' weaknesses, and the battle terrain. \n Surviving countless assassination attempts, King Azoun was never unarmed, he often had a long   magical   tucked away in his boot, along with other magical items ready for every occasion. \n When making public addresses, Azoun preferred the term \"Cormyte\" over the more usual \"Cormyrean\" or \"Cormyrian\". \n Azoun's court in Suzail was famous across the realms for its refinement.

The canal would have enabled Cormyr to trade with the western states without needing to take overland routes that were harassed by the  .

On his orders, their officers were shut and their goods confiscated, while any caravans found to be working for or with them would be seized. While the Iron Throne declared it would appear, Vangerdahast scoffed at the notion. \n In the  , Azoun was on a hunt with Baron  , Duke  , and   when he was poisoned by a magical abraxus in the  , putting him in a coma-like state. \n King Azoun died at the culmination of   that started in   and ended in  . The dragon   amassed an army of orcs, grodd goblins, the seven   to attack Cormyr.

War Wizards, loyal nobles, and Royals were part of the retinue, as was  , clad in her blood-caked armours still. Azoun IV was placed in the Royal Crypt below the palace, with his daughter by his side. The coffins were warded with powerful magics by the Royal Magician.  \n There were many rumors and tales of Azoun's encounters with the opposite sex, mostly from before his marriage, and there were a number of children as a result of these relations, but the matter was not discussed openly or officially. \n The face of Azoun IV was on sets of nesting dolls called \"Heroes and Rulers\" that was sold by   for 2  . The same catalog featured puppets that bore an uncanny and truly \"coincidental\" resemblance to the King of Cormyr, for 2 gold pieces as well. \n Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue also sold   sets themed after the Horde and the Crusade for 25 gp. The set featured King Azoun's likeness as well as Lady Alusair's and Vangerdahast's. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Azoun_Obarskyr_IV"},

{"title": "\n\t\t\t\t\t", "text": "Forgotten Realms Wiki Get   now on  !\n READ MORE The   policy outlines what lore and sources are accepted on the Forgotten Realms Wiki and how to resolve contradictions between them. For the purposes of this policy, \" \" is the term given to a piece of Realms- or D&D-related information that establishes its status as an official part of the   fictional universe.\n , so this policy provides guidelines for determining what is considered canon on this wiki, in accordance with authors' recommendations and fan consensus.\n \"Canon\", according to  , is any published source relating to the   campaign setting.  This means that if it is official or licensed published material, then it is official  . This would make video games and other licensed works canon, which would cause inherent problems such as contradictions in the lore and outcomes of decisions by players in the course of gameplay.\n Some authors have disagreed with Ed's view.  , for example, when asked about the  , claimed that canon in the   is whatever you make of it. You can choose whether a particular work is canon or not.  (Some fandoms know this as \"personal canon\".)\n Most are more inclined to agree with Greenwood as he is the creator of the   and, according to the original agreement between him and TSR, everything he writes and says regarding the   is canon, unless or until superseded by published material from TSR or WotC.\n In the case of the   series, their popularity, coupled with sourcebooks, adventures, and several   articles, means that in the eyes of many fans it,  , is almost as much canon as the   campaign setting.\n It wasn't until 5 -edition D&D that designers gave clear views on Forgotten Realms canon.   said in a January 2018   \"...so how we handle that [canon and continuity] now is...  \" and explained an approach of picking and choosing what's best for current needs. In a press briefing before D&D Live in July 2021,     \"For many years, we in the Dungeons & Dragons RPG studio have considered things like D&D novels, D&D video games, D&D comic books, as wonderful expressions of D&D storytelling and D&D lore, but they are not canonical for the D&D roleplaying game. Part of that is we don't want DMs to feel that in order to run the game, they need to read a certain set of novels. We want you to read them for the joy of reading them, but not as homework... When it comes to the RPG, what's important is each DM's story and the story they create with their players... If you're looking for what's official in the D&D roleplaying game, it's what appears in the products for the roleplaying game. Basically, our stance is that if it has not appeared in a book since 2014, we don't consider it canonical for the games.\" In a   a week later,   explained this further, noting \"...what is canonical in fifth edition is not necessarily canonical in a novel, video game, movie, or comic book, and vice versa. This is true not only for lore but art as well.\" and \"Every edition of the roleplaying game has its own canon as well. In other words, something that might have been treated as canonical in one edition is not necessarily canonical in another.\" In practice, this simply puts into words the practices and outcomes of each edition of D&D, which perforce focus on what each edition establishes. The canon is thus a flexible, localized concept. We also interpret their use of \"canonical\" to mean something is either present in a canon or relevant to a canon. Thus, a source that is not canonical is not necessarily removed from the greater canon, only not relevant to the current canon.\n However, while this may be fine for D&D designers and Dungeon Masters, it is not helpful for a wiki endeavoring to document the entirety of the Forgotten Realms and in each edition with neutrality and completeness. Fortunately, the 5  designers invite fans to create their own canon. Therefore, this wiki must establish for itself what it considers canon to determine what is acceptable content, and has done so through the general consensus of its editors.  \n Feel free to discuss articles marked as non-canon on their respective talk pages.\n The original discussions relating to what is and what is not canon can be found on   and at  . Further discussion should be carried out on the Talk page.\n Despite fact checking and research at TSR and WotC, discrepancies in the canon exist. Documenting these discrepancies can be as much a part of writing for the wiki as documenting the Realms itself.\n The article author is not at liberty to pick and choose which information should be included and which should be left out. We have created a hierarchy to determine which information should be given preference when a contradiction is discovered, but  \n The wiki uses a hierarchy to determine, if two sources contradict one another, which is preferred. See   for more information on how to reference a given source.\n In brief, as a rule of thumb, the hierarchy is as follows:\n These are explained in more detail below:\n Adventure material and modules may appear in Realms and core D&D sourcebooks, online articles, and   magazines. Thus they are canon and acceptable on the wiki, as are video games. However, adventures and video games may feature branching storylines, random events, have unnamed protagonists (the PCs or players), no official conclusions, and may deviate from official lore for gameplay reasons. Thus, it is difficult to compile a definitive account of events in them. Therefore,  , that is, fixed information and events. Notes can be included to explain possible outcomes. If a game has only possible conclusion or if sourcebooks or novels confirm an outcome of an adventure, then that outcome may be taken as correct.   Details in the video game or adventure then become supporting information.\n Age is a secondary factor in determining preference of information.   If a new novel contradicts an old sourcebook, the sourcebook should be preferred since it is higher in the hierarchy.\n  Editors are not at liberty to prioritize one edition above another. The lore is generally unchanged from edition to edition, and contradictions arising in different editions should favor the newer edition, but care should be taken to make mention of all editions and reference each.\n Where history is concerned, each edition has a different date, so the usual method is to list each piece of information in chronological order.\n  Age is not a factor in this decision.\n As per  ,  . It is not simply good enough to claim that a piece of information exists within a source. It must be referenced as accurately as possible so that readers may choose to check of their own accord and verify that it is the case.\n A specific   should always be considered to supersede any information in the source material, provided it is from a TSR or Wizards source.\n Keep in mind that  . It is always possible for an obvious error in the canon to be published that will fall outside the guidelines set in place above, or a writer to be unaware of different information in a lesser-known source. In these situations, the preferred order of information should follow common sense. A clear error may be rejected, an unnecessary retcon can be reinterpreted, and a later source giving a much-abbreviated, mistaken summary of a past source may be disregarded in favor of the more complete past source. Significant secondary information may be included as an alternative version in the article.\n In the case of discrepancies in the lore,   known to the article writer should be included in an article, with references and footnotes to explain the discrepancy, but preference should be given to one particular version. The guidelines for determining preference are provided above.\n To handle discrepancies in an article, give emphasis to the preferred source but do not discredit the other sources. The preferred source may be discussed first, followed by the secondary sources as alternatives, or the secondary sources discussed before the preferred source is given as the final word. Emphasize these alternatives with simple statements like \"It was believed...\" or \"Some sources said...\" or \"Reports suggested...\" You may give dates to these that subtly illustrate the edition. However, avoid embellished statements like \"Sages theorized that...\" that invite the question of which sages where and when. If no change is known to occur in the setting, then do not say there was a change. Avoid statements like \"It was revealed that...\" which may imply a change or exposed secret where none exists.\n Many sources have narrators like  , whether named or presumed, and works of fiction may be from the point of view of a character. In such cases, they may be treated as   and presumed to be mistaken when there is a discrepancy. However, they should generally be considered reliable as they would not be used as narrators otherwise.\n A simple retcon accompanied by a leap in time such as the   and the century-long jump from 3.5 to 4  edition or the   and the decade-long jump to 5  edition may itself be treated as unreliable. For example, if something is attributed to the Spellplague in 4  edition but was actually in place before it in 2  edition, then it may be presumed the earlier information was forgotten or overlooked at the later time.\n Ultimately,  \n Should a dispute arise on what is preferable to what, as per the usual wiki policies on discussions, this should be conducted in a civil and productive manner. A general consensus should be reached before the order of preference is determined.\n Removing or altering a valid, referenced piece of information is never an acceptable resolution to a discrepancy in the source material.\n Fan art is per definition unofficial, and as such is only permissible on personal user pages. Note that certain modified images may be allowed in some cases, but original fan art is never permissible.\n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms_Wiki:Canon"},

All the editors are trying to achieve the same  .\n Due to the collaborative factor involved in creating a wiki of this scale, and due to the fact that editors of all levels of experience are contributing on a regular basis, articles gradually grow and become modified, and with this, errors can creep in.\n Occasionally things that represent themselves as facts are simply incorrect. Even major encyclopedias contain factual errors. If you come across a piece of information that you know to be wrong, you must be able to find a source that says otherwise! Changing a piece of information because you believe it to be wrong, but not being able to find a source that upholds your beliefs is leaving yourself prone to introducing new inaccuracies. If you can correct the information   provide a canon source, hit the edit button and change it.

Because the Forgotten Realms is owned by an American company, we use exclusively American spellings on this wiki.\n Usually messiness arises because articles aren't created in their entirety in one session. Instead, they are gradually amended by various editors, and sometimes this can lead to an article having information in a nonsensical or confusing order, or being made up of very short or very long paragraphs, or having very awkward English. Please feel free to edit these articles to make them better. Usually, no further information is required; it should simply be a matter of rearranging or rephrasing what is already there.

For example:\n Appears as: A dragon is a scaly, winged creature. \n The wiki will take care of numbering for you. The exact number applied to each citation is not important, merely that the citation number relates to the correct source in the references section. When using citations in this format, you must add a special tag in the References section of the article which informs the wiki where to display the citation details. Although you can use the <references /> tag for this, it is recommended you use the {{ }} template, which takes care of extra formatting details for you:\n For an example of how this will appear, please see the end of this article.\n Give each reference a sensible name. In the example above, the cited book was  , the cited page was 45, and the name of the reference was  , a combination of book acronym and page number. If you wanted to use the same book and page number later in the article to cite another statement, you could write it in shortened format:\n This will work as long as the full citation appears somewhere in the article, and you may use the shortened format as many times in one article as necessary. Please do not use any special characters in the   except the period, the dash, or the underscore. Characters like the hash mark ( ) or the colon prevent the reference popups from working.\n If an entire section of an article can be attributed to one continuous passage in the source material, it is sufficient to provide a citation at the end of the section. It is assumed that all text in the section is cited by the reference provided.\n Most articles will contain references to more than one (and often many) sourcebooks or novels and mostly, the statements in the article are not ordered by source. Each significant statement should have a citation attached, so that the reader is able to find out exactly which book and which page number to view in order to check the statement, or to find out more on the subject. For an example of an article that is comprehensively cited as of 30 March 2007, please see  . Each statement can be attributed to a certain page in a specific sourcebook.\n On other wikis such as  , it is sufficient to provide the details of the book without the page number. The reason for providing page numbers on this wiki is so that the viewer can determine exactly where in a book to start reading. It would be unreasonable to expect a viewer to read through an entire sourcebook in an attempt to find the reference to the statement they are looking for, especially since we as editors are easily able to provide specific page numbers. Also, it is a useful DM tool to be able to use the references section of an article to create a set of bookmarks in specific sourcebooks which she can then read later on, in order to gain the most information possible on a subject.\n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms_Wiki:Help-Citing_sources"},

In October 2005,  , an expansion pack that includes three new modules was released. On October 31st (US) / November 3rd (EU), 2006 a sequel,  , was released.\n Play centers on the development of a character that becomes the ultimate  . In the original   scenario supplied with the game engine, the player is single-handedly responsible for defeating a powerful cult; stopping an insatiable plague; thwarting an attack on the city of  , and many other side quests.\n The first and final chapters of the story in the official campaign deal with the city of Neverwinter itself, but the lengthy mid-story requires the player to venture into the countryside and then northward to the city of  . Neverwinter is a city on the   of  . It is part of the  .\n The original scenario provided with   constitutes the main campaign, encompassing approximately sixty hours of gameplay. This gameplay focuses on the progression of a PC through various adventures, ultimately transforming them into the hero of the narrative. The central objectives for the PC include vanquishing a formidable cult, gathering four essential reagents to halt a plague, and preventing an assault on the city of Neverwinter. While the campaign's initial and concluding chapters concentrate on the city of Neverwinter, the expansive middle segment necessitates the player's exploration of the surrounding countryside and a journey northward to the city of  . Throughout this journey, numerous optional side quests are available for the player to undertake.\n As in  , the initial task for a player is to create a new character. The game offers a selection of pre-made characters, or alternatively, the player can create one from the ground up. A series of panels guide the player through choosing the character's  ,  ,  ,  , ability scores (such as strength and intelligence), specialized abilities known as skills and feats, in-game appearance, and name. This process allows for extensive customization; for instance, a player can opt to be an outdoorsman ( ) or a   ( ) and then select skills and feats that complement that class within the game.\n Following a brief prelude, the original game comprises four chapters, each advancing a segment of the overarching storyline. Within each chapter, players encounter numerous quests, subquests, and mini-storylines. The progression of certain storylines depends on the specific quests completed and the unique items retained, with some narratives unfolding throughout the entire game. Completing many side quests grants the PC additional experience and special items, facilitating their advancement and easing gameplay progression. These improvements manifest as levels earned through experience points, with each level providing the protagonist with a set of enhancements chosen by the player.\n The game's mechanics adhere to the   3  edition rule set. The outcomes of most actions, such as combat and skill usage, are determined randomly by dice rolls. Upon a successful hit, another die is rolled to determine the damage inflicted, with more powerful weapons assigned to dice with a higher number of sides, reflecting their greater damage potential. Although the results of nearly all actions are determined by these dice rolls, the player does not see them, as the calculations occur in the background. However, players have the option to display the outcomes of these rolls. The game can be controlled almost entirely via the mouse.\n A robust multiplayer feature sets   apart from previous   games, enabling players to join various servers hosting diverse games. Depending on the server's hardware and bandwidth, it can accommodate up to ninety-six players along with DMs who can manage the games. The game modules encompass a wide array of genres and themes, including persistent worlds similar to MUDs, combat arenas for player-versus-player engagements, servers focused on sexually oriented roleplay, and simple social gatherings akin to chat rooms. BioWare stipulates that these persistent worlds must be offered free of charge, primarily to adhere to copyright regulations.\n Many persistent worlds are still actively run with updates and improvements. Servers can be linked together as well, allowing the creation of large multi-server worlds. Two early examples include A Land Far Away and Confederation of Planes and Planets.\n Due to the absence of a global chat function, aside from the supported GameSpy, players of   generally join pickup games through the game's multiplayer interface or prearrange games with friends. Matchmaking websites can assist in scheduling these games, providing an experience similar to traditional pen-and-paper role-playing games. Persistent worlds streamline this process by inviting players to visit their websites and continue roleplaying there.\n A key feature of   is the Dungeon Master Client, a tool that enables an individual to assume the role of Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master guides players through the story and has complete control over the server. Upon its release,   was regarded as the first successful implementation of this feature. The DM Client allows players to engage in regular campaigns and supports the growth of persistent world servers by enabling DMs to take control of NPCs mid-game, enhancing realism and flexibility. Additionally, the Dungeon Master Client allows users to spawn and manage large groups of monsters and NPCs similarly to controlling units in a real-time strategy game.\n  ships with the   toolset, which allows players to create custom modules for  . These modules may take the form of online multiplayer worlds, single player adventures, character trainers or technology demos. Additionally, several third party utilities have further expanded the community's ability to create custom content for the game. Custom content creators are known as builders in the   community.\n The Aurora toolset allows builders to create map areas using a tile system; the appearance and surface textures of the area are defined by the area's selected tileset. Builders can overlay placeable objects onto areas, and use the built-in scripting language NWScript to run cut scenes, quests, mini-games and conversations. NWScript is based on C++.\n Third party utilities allow builders to create custom content for most aspects of the game, ranging from new playable races and character classes to new tilesets, monsters and equipment. Custom content is added to the game in the form of hakpaks. Builders have used the Aurora toolset in combination with hakpaks to create playing experiences beyond the scope of the original campaign. Despite the game's age, the   custom content community remains active.\n The Aurora toolset is not available for the Linux and Macintosh versions of  . The open source project never number of prestige classes the original game had. It also adds dozens of epic spells, and many normal spells that make better use of BioWare's Aurora engine. These include: Teleportation, Transposition, Mazes, Summoning Houses and more. As well, psionic powers have been included, which are essentially spells, but done with \"power points\", akin to the sorcerer class. This \"expansion\" can be found at nwn-prc.com, along with documentation.\n Despite the game's age, the   custom content community remains vibrant and active. Primarily centered on the [Neverwinter Vault  ], this community has produced over 4,000 modules for the game. Among these are numerous award-winning adventures and series, showcasing the enduring creativity and dedication of the community.\n In late 2004, BioWare launched its online store and started selling what it called premium modules as part of its digital distribution program. This initiative was spearheaded by BioWare's Live Team Lead Designer,  . Though technically not expansions, these smaller-scale adventures introduce new storylines and gameplay. They often include new music and art that BioWare claims will be integrated into future patches and updates to the core game. The most recent patch, 1.69, includes a great number of the art and music that you find in the premium modules.\n According to BioWare, the revenue generated is used to support their fan community and provide ongoing updates and improvements to the popular game. Unfortunately the modules that are sold for download require internet access to play even though they are single player only. The modules in the Kingmaker expansion were stripped of this requirement but are only for Windows. The modules included with Neverwinter Nights Diamond Edition do not require Internet access to play.\n A sequel to  ,  , was developed by  , a company which had long been working with BioWare.

As he is collecting these monsters, he is attacked by mysterious assassins from the cult that is behind the spreading of the plague.\n As the cure is being made, Castle Neverwinter is attacked by Desther's minions. He takes the completed cure and escapes the castle, with the player character and Fenthick in pursuit. When they catch up to Desther, he surrenders after a short battle. Desther is sentenced to burn at the stake, and Fenthick, despite being unaware of Desther's true intentions, is sentenced to hang.\n The player character meets up with Aribeth and they begin searching for the cult responsible for the plague and the attack on Neverwinter.

It was named for and apparently based on the   miniatures wargame developed by   and Jeff Perren that was a precursor to  .   executive Jon Berg had asked Johnson to develop a screenplay based on D&D, despite Warner Bros. not then having the rights. Described as an action-adventure fantasy film, Johnson's script was well received at Warner Bros. in August 2012.  So well received that, by September 18, 2012, Warner Bros. acquired rights from   and   of Sweetpea Entertainment (the D&D movie rights holders since acquiring them from   in the early 90s and known for the original   movie in 2000) to make a new   live-action movie. It was to be produced by   and   of   ( ,  ) and executive produced by Solomon and Zeman. The   script was adopted and appropriately enough retrofitted to suit   just as its namesake game had been, and renamed  . This was widely reported on May 7, 2013. \n However, only a day later, it was reported  , owners of   and therefore D&D, were arguing the movie rights were theirs and furthermore were planning a movie with  , directed by Chris Morgan (writer of the   franchise and  ).  They subsequently developed a script, titled  , its logline \"Kept under wraps.\" by March 24, 2014.  This was the first connection of either movie to the   setting.\n There followed much complicated legal wrangling beyond the scope of a D&D wiki, but it did depend on whether   was a sequel to the previous   and   movies. They, and D&D fandom, will never know the answer to that question as, following a six-day trial in September 2014, Hasbro, Warner Bros., and Sweetpea settled out of court on the rights to a D&D movie.  On August 3, 2015, it was reported they planned to make the D&D movie together, continuing the Warner Bros. project with the involvement of Hasbro's chief executive   and chief content officer Stephen Davis as producers. According to Greg Silverman, president of creative development and worldwide production at Warner Bros., \"We are so excited about bringing the world of Dungeons & Dragons to life on the big screen. This is far and away the most well-known brand in fantasy, which is the genre that drives the most passionate film followings. D&D has endless creative possibilities, giving our filmmakers immense opportunities to delight and thrill both fans and moviegoers new to the property.\" Still using Johnson's   script, it was said to be set in the  .  In an interview with Collider at DICE 2016, Roy Lee suggested the Warner Bros. movie would be an ensemble picture, with a group of main characters, and have an adventurous feel, commenting \"This new   will be a  \u2013tone movie in a Tolkien-like universe. Because when you think of all the   movies and  , they have an earnestness to them, and to see something fun, a   romp inside that world, I feel is something the audience has not seen before.\" Of Warner Bros., he said \"I believe they see   as something that could be cultivated as a multi-universe movie where there will be spinoffs from the first movie being in   and subsequent movies being in different worlds.\" He also promised it would go deep into the source material and that the writer and others were all long-term D&D fans: \"everyone who's involved with it now, especially the writer of the first draft is a fan from the very beginning starting with Chainmail, which turned into Dungeons & Dragons, so you'll see things that are very faithful to the source material as well as new elements are being incorporated with help from Wizards of the Coast, who are giving a lot of input on the script.\" He revealed the movie would be entirely set within the  , with the   being a prominent feature and set piece of the movie. \n On March 31, 2016,   ( ,  ) was confirmed to direct the D&D movie after a successful presentation to executives.  Meanwhile, producers were rumored to be looking for an actor like  , a well-known D&D fan.  On June 27, 2016,   ( ,  ) was reported to be in early talks to star.    was also in discussions to star at some point. \n However, a year and a half later, on December 18, 2017, Warner Bros. confirmed it was no longer developing a   movie, while Paramount Pictures suddenly announced their own, to be released on July 23, 2021. This was alongside other movies based on other Hasbro properties, as part of a shared universe with Hasbro's Allspark Pictures. \n On February 20, 2018,   (director of  ) was reported to be in negotiations to direct the   movie. Davis, Goldner, Lee, Solomon, and Zeman were all still producing. Michael Gilio was apparently rewriting Johnson's script.  On March 8, 2018, Paramount was reportedly considering filming in the United Kingdom.  It was reported on November 2, 2018, that principal photography would begin in summer of 2019. Furthermore,   (a visual effects producer for many Paramount movies) was added as a producer. \n On March 12, 2019, it was reported Gilio had submitted a new script and Paramount was so satisfied that, while final revisions were being made, they would begin looking for a new lead male actor from a shortlist of A-listers, naming  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . \n However, Chris McKay moved on to another movie and by July 30, 2019, was replaced as director by   and   (directors of   and co-writers of  ).  Daley learned to play D&D while playing a geek character in  . In a later interview with FANDOM, Daley said \"I'm an avid player... it's set in a fictional world that our DM created, but it definitely utilizes a lot of the creatures and monsters from the manual.\" and \"I also play a video game with my son   and  ... it's a nice bonding moment for us. So it's very much in my DNA at this point.\" He added \"I'm a half-elf paladin, and I've been that for the last five years.\" His character's name is mentioned in the movie; \"That was the most exciting moment for me, not seeing my name on the screen but hearing my character.\" but noted \"he's not representative of the character that I created for myself, it was really just a name check.\" \n Two days later, a source told wegotthiscovered.com that Goldstein and Daley were trying to get   to play an important character named Malanthius, a big but not leading role. \n Eventually, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic causing studio closures, filming delays, and difficulties, on April 24, 2020, the movie was delayed from November 19, 2021, to May 27, 2022, putting it in the middle of blockbuster movie season. By now, Goldstein and Daley had taken over scriptwriting.  By May 7, 2020,  , a producer of several movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, had signed on with Hasbro's Entertainment One (eOne) studio and would work on the   movie.  On May 28, 2020, The Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Goldstein and Daley, in which they discussed how the pandemic lockdown affected their plans for the D&D movie, among other things. Their plans to scout locations in the United Kingdom in March were curtailed by the shutdown of travel, and they wrote the second draft while in isolation, while large crowd scenes were being reconsidered. Goldstein said \"We want it to be fun. It's not an out-and-out comedy, but it is an action-fantasy movie with a lot of comedic elements and characters we hope people will really get into and enjoy watching their adventures.\" while Daley said \"D&D is such a unique look at the fantasy genre where it is contemporary in terms of the people playing it and the way they speak to each other. So we never wanted to spoof the genre of fantasy or take the piss out of it. But we did want to find another way into it that we hadn't necessarily seen before. Just the format of Dungeons & Dragons is so interesting and fun and all about critical thinking and thinking on your feet and figuring out ways to make things work after they fall flat. There's a lot of the spirit of that that we're trying to inject into the movie itself.\" \n Concept art was provided in 2020 by   over March to May  and by   over July to October.  Gerrard later wrote \"I had to fight to get on the D&D movie. Not because of my ideas but my style. The known generalisation of my style was dark, monochrome, evil! The Director wanted colourful, fun, vibrant so the Production Designer had to push my work. It was a hard sell but he had faith in me. Each day he would say more colour, more character and so on. So I came up with a process to train myself... It worked!\" \n Cinematographer   announced on Instagram on August 23, 2020 \"D&D coming soon.\" and confirmed filming in Ireland, while sharing an image of a dragon's eye.  This is a recolored and cropped version of a  , suggesting it is a mock-up if nothing else.\n On April 4, 2021, Paramount announced delays for ten of its movies, including the D&D movie, which was pushed back from May 27, 2022, to March 3, 2023. \n The visual special effects and animation are handled by  , famous for   and many Marvel comics movies and series,  and by the  , a VFX studio involved in countless movies and series, including   and   in the fantasy genre. In 2021, MPC began hiring for the 'Untitled Dungeons & Dragons' movie, calling for \"a fire breathing FX demon or an Animation wizard\" and \"a CG Supervisor that maxes out in (STR), (DEX), (CON), (INT) and (WIS).\"  Many creatures would be handled by animatronics. Hugh Grant later recalled, \"Just when you thought you were doing a rather powerful or amusing little bit of acting, you'd realise there was a fucking dragon walking past you in the background, stealing your thunder. There was a lot of incredibly intricate, I don't know what you call it... Animatronics! Terrifying. A fish that eats babies! And suddenly the whole floor of the set would be quicksand! I wish I'd had my children with me. They would have liked that.\" \n To integrate the storyline with the lore of D&D and the   during writing and production, Goldstein and Daley had the involvement of Wizards of the Coast representatives Nathan Stewart, Head of Franchise and VP of Global Brand Marketing & Strategy, and  , Principal Designer for D&D. Goldstein said in the interview with FANDOM, \"Wizards of the Coast generally were involved very much throughout the process in the writing stage and on set, and we would consult them with any questions we had, any issues we had. And they were really helpful because\u2014it wasn't in the spirit of 'you can't do that', it was 'let us help you figure out how you can do that in the world we've created'. Latcham added \"Yeah, and Nathan and Jeremy at Wizards were just like tremendously helpful and still are.\" and gave an example of ensuring accuracy in a map presented in the film, adding \"Because some things you're looking for authenticity and some thing's you're looking for accuracy and I think in that case accuracy would be appreciated... It's usually like how do we do this inside the world and make it right, and then sometimes it's like how do we make the movie exist in the world more specifically and so, it's really fun.\" Daley said \"We actually went up to Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Seattle and did a crash course in some of the lesser-known aspects of the game and it was wildly helpful and we ended up incorporating a ton of stuff in the movie just from that meeting.\" They also had assistance from Ashley Alexander, Senior Director of Film Development & Sales at eOne and a producing partney; Daley said she \"is like a bonafide D&D nerd who knows way more than i do about it and she was an invaluable resource.\" They also made use of D&D Beyond, with Latcham saying \"We all had all-the-time access to D&D Beyond so it's just like 'okay, hold on, hold on, no that's not right', and the actor is like 'what's happening?' and we're 'we'll get back to you in one second, we have to work something out'.\" But most importantly, when asked \"How much did you use the Forgotten Realms Wiki for research, Daley answered \"A ton, a ton! ...Honestly, sometimes on-set.\" \n  ( ,  ) was reported on December 14 to be in negotiations to star.  The next week, the site Illuminerdi claimed an exclusive report, giving details about Chris Pine's character, called Edgin. \n By February 8, 2021,   (  and   franchises among others) and   (  and  ), had closed deals to star in the movie, while Chris Pine was confirmed.  In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Rodriguez revealed her role as a barbarian: \"You know what, I'm gonna be a barbarian in this one. And so, you know, I've just been training. I've been\u2014 lots of protein, oh my god, and I'm hoping to gain the weight necessary to just be able to carry an axe appropriately. So I'm in the mix with Chris, Chris Pine, I can't wait to work with him. I've always heard nothing but great things about this guy. And we're about to be in Ireland, man, you know, in the bubble.\" The bubble is coronavirus precautions, with testing three times a week. \n  ( ,  ) was added a week later.  In an interview with   in May, 2021, Page explained he wasn't a D&D player but said \"I've listened to a couple of   podcasts in my time. I played a ton of JRPGs and basically everything that's come out of it. I played a ton of   as a teenager, so I'm used to the fact that I play a paladin\u2014that's just what I do, and I know what that means, to a degree. I watched my friends play  , so I'm like a second-generation 'Dungeons and Dragoner'.\" He recruited friends to teach him about D&D, adding \"There is nowhere better or bigger to learn new worlds from than D&D.\" He said he was attracted by the   movie script, observing it had stepped up and raised the bar for fantasy movies and would be a \"huge sigh of relief for Dungeons & Dragons fans everywhere.\" Goldstein mentioned Page's role \"allows him to show a full spectrum of his talent\" and \"He naturally exudes a sense of dignity and heroism that is fitting for the fantasy genre, and is perfect for the role we cast him in.\" \n , star of countless films, and   ( ,  ) were later reported to have joined by March 2. Grant was stated to be playing a villainous role.  Various news sites added the rumor that Grant's character would be named \"Forge Fletcher\" and Lillis's \"Doric\", but the basis for this is unknown.  In an interview with Screen Daily published on June 24, Grant said he hadn't played   before but the movie, as a \"great big, expensive Hollywood blockbuster\" offered the chance to do something different and said \"But more than that I laughed at the script. It's hard to please me, but it had real charm and moved me. I was certainly not expecting that.\" He could neither confirm nor deny reports that he'd be playing the villain. \n  ( ,  ) was added to the cast by April 21.    ( ) was reported on May 13 to be playing a character called Drallas (also reported as Dralas).  Earlier, on May 1, he posted a video on Instagram of himself having a full head cast made, likely for a mask for his role.  A week later,   ( ) was reported to have joined the cast. \n  ( ,  ) revealed in an interview with Alex Zane of the Just the Facts podcast, released June 2, that he had a small role in the   movie: \"I just did Dungeons & Dragons as well... I only did it the other day as a favor, for a mate... Marlamin, he's called. I am Michelle Rodriguez's ex-husband... I think I'm a goodie. It's hard for me to say, because I've got one scene where she comes and sees me, in my little house. I'm really diminutive, I've got a very tall wife... They gave me one scene, I don't know what that's about... They were like 'Can you come and do this one scene, it'll just be really lovely.' ...I had a big beard.\"  His character would be replaced with a cameo of Bradley Cooper, however.\n And a dog: Antilly, a German Shepherd from Stunt Dogs and Animals, (  and  ) appears in some scenes, it was later reported. \"She's got loads of stuff coming up, she's going to be in the new  \u2014we went to Northern Ireland to film that last summer.\" said her handler.  However, these dog scenes were apparently cut.\n Ahead of shooting, the main cast played a campaign of D&D together to get familiar with the game and each other. \n Filming was planned to begin in the first quarter of 2021, in Belfast, Northern Ireland,  at Titanic Studios, where   was filmed.  However, the first filming took place in South Iceland, supervised by Truenorth Productions, as reported on April 7. Some 60\u201370 people were involved, using Icelandic stand-ins for the main cast who couldn't attend due to pandemic restrictions, and 15 visitors from overseas.  By a fortunate coincidence, the   volcano had begun erupting on March 19, with the first lava flow in the area for 6000 years. The production team used the opportunity to film scenes with it as a backdrop. \n On the first day of production, rather than rehearsing, the cast and directors played a game of D&D together. Daley would recall, \"The first day, rather than using our precious time to rehearse, we decided to play a three-plus hour game. The Wizards of the Coast were nice enough to give us a Dungeon Master on Zoom and we played. And it was hilarious and really educational, because I think they all learned about their characters more, and I think we incorporated some of the things that came out of that.\" \n With the main cast, filming proper began in Belfast on April 29, with Goldstein posting a picture of the movie clapperboard for the first scene on Twitter on May 1, announcing \"The campaign begins. #DnD\",  and Barry Peterson posting the same on Instagram with \"Our adventure begins.\"  Photographs of Titanic Studios taken around May 15\u201317 showed parts of the old King's Landing sets for   were rebuilt and others retained, with a new dark stone structure, artificial snow, and a blue screen added, seemingly for  , though there may be some overlap with the GoT prequel  .  Castle Street in Glenarm was closed for filming of   from May 26. \n Filming began in the village of  , Northern Ireland, on May 14; it had also been a location for  .  Images of location filming being set up on the coast nearby appeared thereafter. \n Filming was scheduled to take place around   and Wells, Somerset, in England on June 2\u20135 and 8\u201312.  Filming proper started on June 10, with first images showing Chloe Coleman and other actors in costume. Michelle Rodriguez was sighted half in costume a day or so later, and Hugh Grant shortly after. \n Rumors also had filming scheduled to occur at   (a location used for several movies) in Alnwick, Northumberland, with preparations going back to May 26th and the castle closed for a \"private event\" over June 7\u201312.  Photos on June 4 showed the castle being embellished with fake lion-topped plinths and garden features, tracks being erased, tents outside and a market inside for the   movie.  The first images of filming at and around Alnwick Castle appeared on June 7 and 8, showing the castle hung with banners, some displaying the blue three-snowflakes symbol of Neverwinter, confirming at least some of the movie is set there, and the same symbol in yellow and orange within a sun. Later images showed these sun banners removed. Other images showed warriors in armor and head tattoos, a boat on a river, artificial smoke or mist, a collection of tents outside and a small market inside, and extras dressed as knights, peasants, nobles, and merchants (see Gallery, below).  Images of filming at Wells Cathedral from June 10 showed Chloe Coleman, Michelle Rodriguez, and Hugh Grant in costume, and similar knights and noble characters in medieval dress. \n From around June 24, posts on social media reported film crew trailers and stages being set up at  , in the castle, car park, and harbor. This was dressed as a docks with boats and stacks of cargo and the castle entrance was given false stonework. Images appeared on social media of medieval armored boats and paraphernalia, as well as Sophia Lillis in dressing gown and medieval boots hidden behind an umbrella. Friend of the FRW   later visited the castle and found it fenced off, and took pictures and a   from the scene.  On June 26, Michelle Rodriguez was seen arriving on set in costume, mask and dressing gown.  On June 28, Chris Pine and Hugh Grant were seen at the castle in costume, with a glimpse of horned character who might be Sophia Lillis.  The following day, Justice Smith, Chloe Coleman, and Sophia Lillis, as well as Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez, were all seen on set and joking together.  June 30 was reportedly the final day of location filming at Carrickfergus with the actors, though more filming with stuntwork was expected. \n A few prominent boats were seen at Carrickfergus Castle. The most notable is a large black-hulled vessel covered over with spiked armored plates, with a single mast with dark-blue sails, and a battering ram ending in a   head, colored to resemble old copper. It resembles a  . Coleman, Lillis, Pine, Rodriguez, and Smith appeared have scenes on board.  This ship was later transported to Titanic Studios  It would later feature prominently on a screen behind Daley and Goldstein in their D&D Direct video  and in the trailers.  Two other ships are of Irish design: a   and a   with black-painted hull (teal or aquamarine below the waterline) and red sails.  The Galway hooker was apparently transported from Abu Dhabi in a temperature-controlled container to preserve its sails. \n Again from social media, the next sites for location filming are apparently the abandoned village of   (previously a   site) and  . Visitors reported Galboly to be fenced off by June 27 for a few weeks for filming of  , starting July 7.  Nearby Glen Road in Glenariffe was closed for filming of   from June 29.

Aerial photos on July 11 showed the cottage set built for   had been remodeled with new door-frame pillars and door, windows, added thatch and moss on the roof, and a chimney, with gardens or farms under construction.  A week later, people were again able to visit Galboly, and took close-up pictures of the remodeled cottage. \n On July 31 and August 1, the dragon-headed boat was seen sailing on  , a lake in Northern Ireland, presumably for filming. It was accompanied by safety boats and a helicopter. \n Filming for Hugh Grant and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page wrapped on August 8. This was reported soon after on Twitter by Jonathan Goldstein, who said \"and damn are they good in this movie.\"  Photos of Titanic Studios tweeted on November 16 showed the D&D movie set occupying the former King's Landing street set, with a market scene and the sun symbol banners appearing once more. \n Filming overall wrapped on August 19, as reported on Twitter by John Francis Daley.  Barry Peterson posted a group shot of the lighting crew at Titanic Studios to Instagram around August 22, declaring \"That's a wrap on Dungeons & Dragons.\"  On February 3, he posted a behind-the-scenes image of lighting control screens and cranes, teasing \"D&D what's behind the curtain.\" \n Nevertheless, shooting with extras would continue as late as March 2022. \n In an interview with Collider on September 9, Justice Smith said of the   movie \"[Goldstein and Daley are] incredible. They're so funny and they have such clear vision. I loved  . That movie is so good and so funny. And it's such a clear, specific story. It doesn't try and be anything that it's not. I think they approached this the same way. I can't spoil too much but it's action-packed, thrilling, funny as hell\u2026 it's all of the things and yet it has a clear idea. That specificity is key in storytelling and John and Jonathan do that so well, being like, \"This is the story we're telling but they're making it enjoyable the entire time.\" This is me not trying to spoil the movie in any regards. I've given away no details.\" \n Chris Pine, when asked about the movie in an interview with Collider published on March 18, 2022, said \"Well, what I will say is we had a hell of a fun time making it. There was a lot of laughs. The way that I've been describing it, it's like   mixed with a little  , just a smidge of  ; it's somewhere in that ballpark. It's a lot of fun. It's got a lot of thrills. It's poppy, it's eighties heartfelt, there's a bit of   in there. My character, he's the ultimate party planner. I think it's going to be really good. I mean, who \u2014ing knows, but I think we got a good shot and John and John are killer guys. They know comedy and they know heart and we had a great cast and we had a good time making it. And that's all you can ask for.\" \n Hasbro's 2022 Ignite/Innovation Showcase for investors and retailers on March 26, 2022, briefly mentioned the D&D movie. Jenny Whitlock, VP of Global Franchise Strategy & Management, said \"Turning to Wizards' other iconic brand, Dungeons & Dragons, get ready to embark on a new adventure next spring, with an epic cinematic event. Releasing only in theaters March 3rd, 2023, this live-action feature film stars an impressive roster of talent and will introduce audiences around the world to this legendary and expansive story universe.\" \n The D&D Direct online event on April 22, 2022, viewable  , had a teaser video revealing the full logo and title of the movie:  .

It's a dream come true to bring the   and the Sword Coast to life. We set out to capture the spirit of fun and surprise that we all love about D&D.

Actors were available for meetings with press; IGN interviewed Lillis and Rodriguez about their characters and experience with D&D  and Entertainment Weekly interviewed the main cast, producer, and directors, revealing final character names and details. A great deal of information came out to the press and audience in a panel, with behind-the-scenes footage and additional clips from the movie, depicting a scene of interrogating slain soldiers via   to find the location of a magical helmet and an extended arena battle scene, with reports of a homage to the   cartoon series in the form of rival adventurers.  The first trailer, seen  , was also unveiled at the convention, along with an official synopsis. The soundtrack was \"Whole Lotta Love\" by Led Zeppelin.    and Todd Kenreck discussed various things seen in it another video,  , confirming various plot details, such as Doric's tiefling race and the Revel's End prison being created to link with the movie.

An interview with writer-directors Daley and Goldstein confirmed and gave more of these, naming Daisy Head's character and revealing Szass Tam as the ultimate villain.  A tweet from Goldstein teased the appearance of the Cult of the Dragon, by showing extras in costume armor waiting in line at a port-a-loo. \n Tweet announcing Early Access Fan Event Screening limited-edition cloth map. In an interview with IGN on February 19  at IGN Fan Fest, Daley and Goldstein revealed the movie would have no meta narrative, that is, there would be no scenes of gameplay in real-world nor characters from   falling into the   as had often been speculated in press. Daley: \"This is not  . We talked about it, but we made a decision that we did not want to break the fourth wall. There's so much fun to be had just in the world of D&D that we didn't have to bring it into our world and show kids playing.\" Goldstein: \"We felt, in fact, that it would be sort of limiting the absolute scope of this world if we were to sort of put it through the lens of a game being played.\" On adherence to D&D rules, Goldstein also noted \"We definitely played by the rule of cool when it came to how much we adhere to the game mechanics. Very often, I think we do have a lot of turn-based action. And all the spells and monsters and creatures that they come across are authentic to the lore, but we definitely took some liberties to give you the most action-packed fun that we could.\"  IGN also displayed   showing the   scene. \n The official \"Dungeons & Dragons Movie\" twitter [unavailable now] reported  early access fan event screenings would give away a limited-edition cloth map of Neverwinter branded with the logo of the movie.\n As to the story itself, various versions have been reported or rumored.

Darryl Mott of Enworld offered more cogent reasons for this: as a placeholder description for copyright preregistration, it does not need to be official and may be an earlier or falsified version to prevent spoilers.

A new goddess of magic named Mystra was born, and she was able to repair the Weave in a way that such powerful spells could never be used against it again. \n While the shared belief among most scholars was that the new Mystra altered the Weave to prevent another similar catastrophe, others offered another interpretation.

In actuality, hags simply called upon the Weave in ways that were different from others. \n Weird magic took on a multitude of forms with various means of activation, all of which were strange and unusual to other creatures. Each hag spent her life time developing her weird magic. Because of this individualized nature to weird magic, it was impossible to predict what a hag was capable of. And because hags carefully shepherded their use of weird magic, it was often impossible to duplicate or replace the magic items they created. \n This ancient form of magic,   in  , meaning the  ,  went far and beyond normal spellcasting, often affecting massive areas and vast populations of their kind.

These books went by other names such as  , a workbook used by mages during travel, and  , large, often disproportional anthologies of magic. \n Arcane casters from certain wizard guilds could also often access magical reservoirs known as  . These locations allowed casters, who had been granted access, to swap one known spell for another that had been placed within the pool, albeit at the cost of one of their own. \nThe   extensively used by the   and the   allowed groups cooperating spellcasters to grant extraordinary powers to a leading wizard. \n Divine casters were required to pray to their patron deity for access to the power of their spells. The time of day of these prayers would typically be at dawn, noon, dusk or at midnight, depending on the deity.  For example, priests of   prayed for their spells in the morning,  while the clergy of   prayed just before sundown. \n The casting of both arcane and divine spells required certain components. Some spells only needed one or two, while others required all three:\n The power and energy of both arcane and divine spells could also be imbued into items.  Many items shared similar effects to the point where they were named, such as    or   armor,  while others, such as the    , had unique properties.  The most powerful magical items, typically created by  ,   or even the gods themselves were known as   and  . The main difference between the two being the significance of the latter to a particular faith or holy sect.  Most magical items drew upon power from alternative  . \n Although there could be a dozen different ways to create the same magical item, the crafting process generally followed the same steps: \n This form of magical writing, similar to the process of inscribing  , originated from the   of  .   Symbols of the Dwarven written language of  ,  were painted, drawn or engraved on a surface and imbued with a spell's magical energy. \n After a  , or other rune-inscribed surface, was imbued with magic it would be triggered by touch.

A practitioner of this long-since-lost art could imbue a gem with the effects of a spell, affix it to another item, say the pommel of a sword or end of a staff, and in the willful process of destroying the gem, release the spell's effects. \n Other items created with these attuned gems, known as  , could be harmlessly handled until their wielder chose to trigger their effects. These preservative items tended to be enchanted with protective magics. \n While capable of travelling vast distances across Toril, or even to other  , portals were simply just a permanent   effect (akin to the spell  ). For a magical means of conveyance, they were particularly durable, often remaining for centuries or millennia after their creation. \n Portals came in a number of varieties including, keyed portals, which required a specific trigger to activate,  portal networks, where one portal entrance had multiple destinations,    to the island of   and the   that permanently connected Toril to the four  ,  among others.\n The world of Toril was abundant with places of magical power, both natural in origin and artificially created.

It held the world of  , the  , the  , and extended out into space to the stars.   out into space was a question of cosmology, and the answer might depend on which cosmological model was used to describe the Prime Material plane. But there were many other planes of existence, some very much like the Prime and some so alien that they almost defied description. Like other dimensions, these other planes might overlap, surround, or penetrate the Prime Material plane, or they might be connected by some mystic avenue, often requiring   to explore. Together, all the various planes were usually referred to as the \"multiverse\"  and they were the focus of cosmologists as they tried to map, measure, and understand the planes and their relationship to life, to death, and to each other.\n There have been numerous theories on the structure of the multiverse over the ages. The three major ones are as follows:\n These models are simply that\u2014models. They were theoretical ideas to make sense of the strange reality of the multiverse by mortal sages. \n At first it was thought that there was an infinite number of material planes, among them the Prime Material plane within which Toril resided, the   material plane,  's material plane,  's material plane, and the universe in which   was located. \n As the existence of other worlds started to be confirmed, each of the cosmological models had a way of explaining how they connected, related, or coexisted with one another. Of course, the scholarly inhabitants of each world thought that theirs was the Prime Material plane, but even early cosmological models showed that this was just a point of view.

These planes existed in unknown, nigh unreachable places and only a few well-informed scholars even knew of their existence. These planes might drift distantly in one of the fundamental planes or lie entirely outside of the World Axis or any of the other models.

Over the decades, the organization experienced several leaps and bounds in terms of successes,  but also major misfortune, particularly for their historical strongholds around the  .  As of   the Zhentarim was headquartered in the  , at  , nestled in the  . \n As an extension of the will of the dark wizard  , the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the   with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faer\u00fbn.  After he recruited the faithful of Bane, unscrupulous merchants and lesser   to his cause,  they collectively sought to dominate all aspects of the Realms, either by manipulation, outright control, or, if they couldn't exert control over something, extinction. \n After the mass purge by the Cyricists, known as the  , and the subsequent partial destruction of   following the   debacle, the control of the Zhentarim passed to the Bane-worshiping  . He made secret deals with leaders in the Moonsea to erect temples to  , Bane's divine son, within the capitals of their city-states. His aim to extend the will of the Lord of Tyrants across Toril was a dynamic factor behind many of the changes within the organization. \n By the late 15  century DR, the goals of the Zhentarim returned to their original ideals, despite their more benign public perception. By offering the   guards and mercenaries, with the final aim of an iron-fisted monopoly on protection services in the Realms, they sought to make the merchants of Faer\u00fbn, and thus the continental economy, completely reliant upon them as an organization. While many of the practices and services they offered were completely legal, they were not above spending a tremendous amount of gold to destroy their competitors and secure future profits to increase their wealth, influence, and power. \n In order to achieve their financial goals, the Zhentarim agents often dealt in illicit goods and contraband, using their extensive mercantile contacts to move products throughout the Moonsea, neighboring lands and over Faer\u00fbn's more hazardous terrains. The types of commodities they dealt in were slaves,  , drugs and even    . \n As a means of eliminating their competition, the Zhentarim used the   army of Zhentil Keep or recruited bands of monstrous   to take down rival caravans, often completing the route under their own banner to earn good faith and new business with merchant groups. They were not above resorting to sabotage, blackmail, and arson to outright murder to undermine their mercantile or political opponents. They were even known to purposefully upset the balance of natural beasts, stir up aggressive monster populations within the wild, and even have their   summon foul monstrosities to threaten isolated towns and villages, in effect forcing the residents to rely on the protection of the Zhentilar. \n From the early years of the organization until  , the Zhentarim was led by the triumvirate of  , the ultimate authority and Lord of  ;  , his student in the arcane who presided over Darkhold; and  , the High Priest of Bane.  However, the Zhentarim was rife with mistrust, even amongst its upper echelons. While Manshoon had a bond of trust with his pupil Sememmon, his relationship with Fzoul was one of mutual disdain shrouded by public respect. While the three shared the same goal of increasing their collective wealth and power, it was at best an uneasy alliance that ultimately fell apart. \n In addition to his role as the ultimate authority of the Zhentarim, Manshoon held the title of High Lord of Zhentil keep, speaker of the city-state's  , and had the full backing of the Zhentilar army.  He kept close control over the Moonsea Zhentarim, and controlled the other city states such as  , the Citadel of the Raven, and even  .  Prior to the partial destruction of Zhentil Keep, Manshoon moved his operations over to the Citadel. \n The obedient and skillful lieutenant of Manshoon long served as the Lord of Darkhold and unfailingly loyal servant of the Zhentarim.  Due to its distance from Manshoon and the Moonsea Zhentarim, the mage-lord only recruited the most loyal and capable agents, about 1000 strong, to the dark keep hidden within the  .  Sememmon's second-in-command was the powerful mage  , a former  , his consort and true love. \n Before he became the   of Bane following the  ,  the faithful servant Fzoul served as the High Priest of his   at the   in Zhentil Keep. \n While many on the   of Zhentil Keep chose positions of subservience or acquiescence to the Zhentarim, a few of the Keep's Lords were active and proud members of the Zhentarim, including: \n Following his ascension during the  , Cyric's followers gained prominence within the Zhentarim. Many of the organization's Banites converted to Cyricism and often had conflicts with those who chose to worship Iyachtu Xvim, Bane's divine son. \n , the Head of Caravans for the Zhentarim, was overseen by the dark mage  . He worked with   who directed individual Zhentarim merchants and   the apothecary. They were served by several caravan masters:  ,  ,  ,  ,  and (after 1369 DR)   and  . \n While not official members of the Zhentarim, their wide-reaching influence gave them access to political powers, military units, and groups of skilled individuals. \n Sememmon was served by group of stealthy killers known as  :  ,  , and  . \n Ashemmi had a number of Zhentarim mages serving as her apprentices. \n After  , the Black Network followed a strict linear hierarchy with Fzoul Chembryl serving as the Zhentarim's Grand Tyrant. Only the powerful lords would report directly to him, while lesser officers and agents would only report to their immediate superiors. \n The only exception to the inherent power structure of the Zhentarim was Manshoon. While he allowed Fzoul to act as the supreme leader of the Zhentarim, he maintained command over any of its agents or resources to further its goals or his own endeavors. \n A number of the leaders of the Moonsea city-states either joined the Zhentarim  or were otherwise manipulated into serving them: \n The Zhentarim had few allies, in comparison to their foes, but they were highly valued for their strategic value. The roster of these supporters were constantly changing along with interests and powers of the Zhentarim.  They included:\n Over the years, the Zhentarim drew the ire and hostility of a great number of peoples and organizations.  They opposed any group they perceived as a threat to their interests to grow their trade and influence across Faer\u00fbn, including the   of the  , the   of  , and the fanatical  .

He then disposed of the high-ranking priests within Zhentil Keep and converted the city's lesser clergy to the worship of Bane.  Paranoid even in the early years of their alliance, Manshoon offset the possible threat of Fzoul's influence by concocting a plan with the beholder Xantriph. They had the Banite priests confess their sins and swear fealty to Manshoon alone. Xantriph's lair, the floating Temple in the Sky, became an outpost for Zhentilar troops and Banite priests in former  . \n Manshoon planned on capturing the Citadel of the Raven during the first days of the Zhentarim, though they were not powerful enough as an organization to openly attack a city of the Moonsea. While it was openly discussed for years, many senior members of the Zhentarim advocated against assaulting the city, fearful of losing their investments that funded the Black Network.  Putting that scheme on hold, they greatly strengthened their economic holdings during the   of  .

Four years later, they invaded and seized   in the  . \n They then conquered and installed their own rulers in   in  .  Manshoon consolidated his rule over all Zhent lands and declared himself the High Lord of Zhentil Keep the  . These actions caused the nations of the Moonsea to grow wary of the Zhentarim and Zhentil Keep. \n Also that year, Manshoon granted the previously occupied   its independence, and maneuvered this act of \"good will\" to call a meeting of the rulers of the Moonsea in the neutral town of  . He called for a garrison to be established at the Citadel of the Raven to protect the greater Moonsea from a horde of orcs that was stirring further north. He \"graciously\" offered to move the recently evicted Zhentilar soldiers from Y\u00fblash to the city,  though this was merely part of a long-term scheme to take over the city. \n The Zhentarim saw significant losses in the next few years when  , puppet ruler of Shadowdale, was assassinated by  ;  Xantriph was killed by the  ;  and  , the puppet ruler of Daggerdale, was killed by  , leading to all-out civil war. \n Despite their losses, the time was right in the   for the Zhentarim to strike against their former allies in the Citadel of the Raven. They had their agents planted within the city kill as many as they could, using   and magic. The orcs and   poured into the city and claimed it for the Zhentarim. One of the few survivors within the Citadel was the mortally wounded  , whose eventual death would lead to the formation of the  . \n During the   of the  , Bane arrived in the  .

After the destruction of the Dark God's  , the newly ascended deity Cyric, who took on his divine portfolio, became the focus of worship for a great number of the members of the Zhentarim. Fzoul Chembryl and a few others maintained their faith, while some others converted to the veneration of  , Bane's divine son. \n In the  , the Zhentarim began their campaign to take control of a trade route that ran through the desert of  . They were initially rebuffed by the unified tribes of the Bedine, aided by the Harper agent   and an exiled   known as  . \n The conflict between the opposing faiths embedded within the Zhentarim culminated in an event known as the  , which began on  , the  .  ,  began a purge of all the remaining Banites within Zhentil Keep, eventually killing his brother and sparing none except for Fzoul Chembryl, due to his \"special relationship\" with Cyric. While the aid of the   allowed Zhentil Keep to grow in power over the next few years,  Manshoon realized that Cyric was no replacement for the calculating cunning and patience of Bane.  \n Over a period of six months in the  , Manshoon quietly and discreetly shifted resources and personnel from Zhentil Keep to the Citadel of the Raven, being distrustful of the impulsive Cyric and his inept clergy members. Fzoul Chembryl saw these actions and remained neutral, still bitter from his loss of influence as the High Priest of Bane. \n Cyric was eventually undermined by a divine conspiracy involving High Lord Fzoul. The larger northern half of Zhentil Keep was left in ruins as a result. Some 1,500 Zhentilar and Zhentarim, many of whom were high-ranking officers, and all the   troops fled the city. \n In the  , Fzoul and Lord   attacked and killed Manshoon.

The Forgotten Realms Wiki was born on October 1st, 2005, whilst Wikia was still named \"Wikicities\". It was created by its first user, admin, and bureaucrat,  , who said on his user page, \"Hello! I am the founder/admin of this wikicity. I do not treat it like my own, this is everyone's wikicity, I merely suggested an idea.\" He kicked off the Main Page and other wiki architecture, designed the first logo, welcomed other users, and started articles about  ,  , and  . However, he became inactive within the month, later leaving the wiki in the hands of   in December.\n For the next year, as the statistics show, the wiki ticked along at a relatively slow but steady pace under a few dedicated editors. Building from the ground up is a difficult task for any wiki. Activity slowed to an almost complete halt in the last quarter of 2006, with little more than 400 articles, before suddenly shooting up to new heights by the end of the year. This may have been the product of a recruitment campaign by Hashimashadoo, bringing in many more editors. But it seemed the FRW had also hit the kind of critical mass needed to attract a lot more interest; despite seasonal fluctuations and external events, activity would never get so slow again. At the end of 2006, long-standing contributors   and   were added to the administration team. The next year and a half saw a period of consistent growth.\n In May 2007, the FRW applied for Featured Wiki status. It eventually won this in January 2008, and was displayed on Wikia's front page.\n The Forgotten Realms Wiki main page as it appeared in December 2007. The  ' advancing timeline proved to be a headache for editors, as articles once written in present tense, reflecting the present state of the setting, had to be rewritten to past tense as events moved on and sources were no longer new. Two users,   and   wondered at this at   in October 2007. Concerned by the changes expected in the coming 4th edition in January, 2008, Fw190a8 also   greater care with dates given to lore. Heaven's Agent had proposed a policy in October 2007, suggesting that editors write with the perspective of being a long time in future\u2014that is, past tense. This sat without comment and unopposed for several months, and Fw190a8 put it in place in June 2008, becoming the   policy.\n The arrival of 4th-edition D&D (in June 2008) and the new 4th-edition   sourcebooks (August/September 2008) contributed to another significant increase in activity, with a marked rise in the number of casual editors, the number of edits made, and the number of new articles in the latter half of 2008. It seems that new fans coming to the   with the new edition and altered setting wanted to see 4th-edition content and post-  lore. However, the changes to the setting had been widely controversial, even unpopular among the existing fandom, and these \"Edition Wars\" were reflected upon the FRW. Some fans would perceive a 4th-edition bias and turn away from the wiki. Behind the scenes, it seems existing editors could not keep on top of the number of new editors and the influx of new lore, and could hardly enforce policies.   and   designed for 3rd-edition rules struggled to accommodate 4th-edition rules, and became much-patched or meaningless.\n This post-4e activity peaked in January 2009, with the FRW's greatest number of casual editors and numbers of edits and new articles per month. At that time, Hashimashadoo raised   to admin status. Activity and number of editors gradually settled back down to normal over the course of the year, perhaps as the new edition smell wore off. Nevertheless, the damage had been done.  , who joined at the end of 2009, tells us, \"many of us editors plodded along mostly by trial-and-error in the early days. The community before 2011 was very fractured and had a wild west, DIY feel. There were broad waves of 4e editors rewriting entire 'core' articles, often deleting entire tracts of previous lore in the name of 'updating' the wikia to the new edition. The mods like Fw190a8, Hashimashadoo, and Cronje were the sheriffs of the day that worked to push for citations and did their best to curb the trolls and unreferenced work. However, most editors had to fight for their own articles, and it was often a case of 'out-referencing' another editor to stop them deleting your work. Many of the battlegrounds drove the editors away as little could meaningfully get done.\"\n The period around September/October 2010 saw the introduction of the   pages, seeing the mass-production of over a thousand new pages, followed by over 4000 edits for formatting, as shown by dramatic peaks in the statistics. Many were placeholders, containing no more than the names of the years, but many others contained historical lore. Unfortunately, much of this had been copied by one particular user from  . Plagiarized content, much of it sneaking in unnoticed, was another significant problem for the FRW, as was homebrew and fan lore.\n The logo for the FRW from February 2008 to October 2015. Nevertheless, the community and the wiki survived. Eli continues, \"However, Fw190a8's golden rule of 'reference everything' endured and was picked up by editors like myself and became well-established when the 2011/12 crop of  ,  ,  ,   &   arrived\". From 2011, Hashimashadoo began raising up long-lasting and quality editors to admin status, with   (who'd started in March 2007) in March 2011 and   (started May 2010) in June 2012, while future admins Darkwynters and Moviesign joined respectively in August and November of 2011. This new crop all quickly became very involved in the running and maintenance of the wiki. Moviesign recalls, \"I guess it says something that my first edits (on any wiki anywhere, I think) were to create and use a {{ }} template. After I got acclimated to wiki work and began some pet projects, I got interested in the more technical side of things and adding new features. My first real template was the {{ }} and I was hooked.\" Darkwynters explains the new dedicated patrolling of the wiki, \"Man, I do DO a lot of patrolling on the wiki. Okay, I will not lie, since 2011 I have basically checked EVERY edit (apart from notable editors) on this wiki, and I will tell you it can be very tiring sometimes. But to me the wiki brought me back from a 4 year hiatus from the  . The Forgotten Realms was a place my teenage self could go to escape all the dark parts of adolescence. This site made me find it again.\"\n However, the wiki had not seen the last of the Edition Wars. At the very end of 2011, a few users were calling for 4th-edition lore to be placed in separate sections or articles, and even for the wiki to be split in two, one for the classic   setting, and a new one for the post-Spellplague setting. These arguments may have arisen more from personal opinion than what was best for the wiki. Moviesign explains, \"The 4th edition controversy was still echoing through the wiki (mostly on Talk pages and  , which was a big deal at the time) and I had quite a few 2nd edition sources that I wanted to use in my contributions, so I spoke out in favor of treating all editions equally...\" Many editors argued eloquently, others with vehemence. Fw190a8 argued at the time \"the best way to improve the wiki... is to just improve the wiki.\" Explaining that such a split would harm the wiki more than help it, admins and regular editors called for more dedicated editors, obedience to and enforcement of existing policies, with no bias toward any edition. Moviesign finishes, \"Thankfully, the wiki did not split and I got to have fun reconstructing templates to handle everything from 1e to the as-yet-mythical 5e.\" Eli the Tanner describes the later atmosphere: \"Post-2011, the community began building new policies that have shaped what we have today. The new climate allowed specialists like   and   to flourish unimpeded.\"\n In January 2012,   proposed a  , designed to focus on   lore over core D&D lore, and to acknowledge the changes of 4th edition while preserving older lore. In practice, this would mean no bias toward any edition. The Edition Wars were briefly resurrected, but the editing community were almost all in favor. The proposal nevertheless lingered until it was bumped in June, and finally implemented by Fw190a8 in October. This edition-neutral view would remain the dominant philosophy.\n February 2012 saw the arrival of BadCatMan, who says, \"I left another wiki with a very hostile admin and non-cooperative community; I wish I'd never gotten involved. Though the quality of the FRW had put me off for years, I found things on the up-and-up and a much more friendly community, and soon became very involved.\" He would regret not getting involved way back in 2006 when Hashimashadoo first advertised in a   play-by-post community they'd played in. Creating articles on   to support his campaigns, BadCatMan developed a lengthy and extremely detailed article on  , introducing a completist approach that formed the basis of future Featured Articles.\n From August of 2012, the number of articles on the wiki actually decreased. Thankfully, this was the result of a clean-up campaign to remove old plagiarized, copyright-infringing, non\u2013 , and homebrew articles, with them being deleted, tagged, or rehabilitated. This would be an ongoing effort, expected to take years to complete, but would lead ultimately to a cleaner, more original wiki. It was not without its troubles, however. In late August, an anonymous user turned troll, apparently annoyed at wholly copied articles being removed, then falsely labeled every dragon article as being copied and demanded their deletion, in a confused and misdirected protest against copyright law, apparently. BadCatMan spent a great deal of time undoing these, and he and Darkwynters calmly argued the wiki's position on copied material, before the troll stormed off. Other serial copiers reacted with incoherent anger, but it was now clear that wiki policies were being enforced, and that the wiki was policed.\n In September 2012, wanting to be able to block trolls and delete articles in order to clean up the wiki, BadCatMan simply asked in the forums how to become an admin, and he and   won admin posts by popular acclaim in October. Unable to regularly weigh in on policy issues, Hashimashadoo bestowed bureaucrat powers on BadCatMan in May 2013. In June 2013, Darkwynters nominated  , and he was duly upgraded to administrator by BadCatMan. As old admins faded away or lost regular access to the online world, BadCatMan, Darkwynters, and Moviesign became a triumvirate managing the wiki on a day-to-day basis, enforcing policies and creating new ones, welcoming and assisting new users, and implementing many new features.\n The   logo is a modification of the 3rd-edition   logo. It was created in October 2010, but not displayed until February 2013. Despite the advances in the background, the   had remained almost unchanged since 2008, with featured articles and images changed less than once a year, and a still fairly plain, basic appearance. Thus, in October 2012, Fw190a8   a new design with a slideshow-based format. Fw190a8, Cronje, and BadCatMan put their heads together, sharing ideas about fresh content, preferably in automatic rotation, but the project languished until   bumped it with fresh ideas. BadCatMan then began a complete overhaul of the Main Page, restoring the old wood-and-sepia color scheme and organizing the design to put lore and features front-and-center. He created a weekly \"Did You Know?\" trivia section, showcasing new articles and editor's work, first rolled out in mid-January 2013, then instituted the new Main Page on February 5th. With coding help from Moviesign, new Featured Article and Featured Source sections were implemented and put in automatic rotation, though a regular Latest Releases section was soon abandoned. Featured Articles would now be decided by community vote, according to stringent guidelines on quality. These Featured Articles would demonstrate completeness, good wiki styling, full referencing, organization of articles of various kinds, and balanced integration of lore from multiple editions and sources.\n The following year, Moviesign created the \"On This Day\" feature, appearing in March 2014, and BadCatMan followed up with a Featured Image section in April 2014, if only to get rid of a long-running picture of  . All this combined led to an engaging and dynamic main page designed to interest readers.\n Early in 2012, Cronje and Moviesign had begun work on revising and standardizing the infoboxes. Such work would be ongoing, with regular additions and revisions. Periodically, throughout 2013 and 2014, Moviesign and others proposed changes to the infoboxes to support all editions, with edition-specific sections and categories. {{ }} and {{ }} received major overhauls in July 2013, and updating pages became a community-wide effort.\n In March 2013,  , admin of the   contacted the Forgotten Realms Wiki to recruit and discuss collaboration and information-sharing. Though the two wikis were very different in form and aims, some lore and articles were shared and inter-wiki links were built, seen in many \"External links\" sections. Inter-wiki links were extended to many other wikis for video games in the   franchise, boosting the chances for traffic to and from the other wikis.\n The FRW enjoyed its 12,000th article in May 2013. After this achievement, feeling the redesigned and dynamic Main Page had put a new face on the wiki, and the active community had given it a new heart, BadCatMan reached out to the   fandom, posting at the   and   forums. Here, he and other editors explained the new philosophies and policies, introduced new features and current work, called for new editors, and fielded questions and concerns. The Edition Wars remained a problem, but the philosophy of edition-neutrality remained firm and became well supported. These communications with the fandom became a semi-regular exercise, alongside BadCatMan's reports to the editing community on how the wiki was doing in ratings and statistics. The new   demonstrated increasing traffic to the wiki, indicating a larger, more interested readership and a raised profile among fans. In fact, the Forgotten Realms Wiki was now one of the larger and more visited wikis on the Internet, and certainly of its type, with Wikia staff regularly contacting admins with new features and changes.\n It was perhaps because of this that the FRW was targeted by high-level trolls. Trolls and vandals have long been a problem for the FRW and all wikis, but two major incidents stand out. On May 9, 2013, one vandalized a number of pages, which were quickly undone by  , and the troll was soon after blocked by Darkwynters. On June 6, 2013, an arch-  from a horde of trolls assaulted the wiki. It defaced the new Main Page and moved it around the wiki to make it harder to undo, while also vandalizing user pages. Fortunately, Darkwynters was on hand, restoring the Main Page after only six minutes, while BadCatMan later spent a half-hour before breakfast thoroughly undoing the page moves. Regrettably, the Main Page had been left unprotected after the redesign, following misguided advice from Wikia. The troll and its hoard, who had attacked several other wikis, were permanently banned from Wikia. \n The FRW had survived one edition change, and now faced another. But this time, it was ready. Policies, infoboxes, and categories designed to accommodate four previous editions had also been designed expecting the next. Fortunately, with 5th-edition sourcebooks and 5th-edition   lore released on a staggered basis from August 2013 through 2014, with no whole campaign setting for the   yet released, the expected deluge became a manageable stream.\n In late 2014, Wikia's   invited the FRW to take part in a voting tournament hosted by the   wiki to promote the new video game. The community accepted, and   was pitted against  ; the dark elf won handily. \n  arrived in November 2014 and quickly impressed, being invited by BadCatMan to become an admin in April 2015. Fortunately, he accepted and stayed.\n In August 2015, Wikia staff announced that a large percentage of readers are accessing the site via mobile devices, but the old wiki markup infoboxes consistently broke when viewed on a mobile device. Moviesign began the long process of converting all the FRW's infoboxes to the new \"portable\" style, while hoping to retain the functionality of the old style. \"I think all of wikidom can be summed up in three little words: work in progress.\" says Moviesign.\n The   logo as of 2015, celebrating 10 years In September 2015, Moviesign reminded everyone of the upcoming 10th anniversary, prompting   of the wiki's own accomplishments and long life. New anniversary-edition logos were designed by   and  , and many more ideas proposed for future implementation. BadCatMan gave a   on the wiki's statistics to date, its successes, and its growing status, as well as its needs for the future. He also pieced together this very history from statistics and user recollections.\n Darkwynters says \"We, admins and editors, are the lore-keepers gathering ALL this great knowledge and keeping it safe for new generations. So cheers to 10 years, cheers to our admins and faithful editors, and, of course, cheers to our readers.\u00a0:)\"\n By January 2016, the wiki was growing by leaps and bounds with 17,693 articles and climbing. Fifth edition was in full swing, having published the  ,  , and the long-awaited FR lorebook   in 2015, followed by  ,  , and   in 2016. But the older editions were not forgotten as the   and   sections of the wiki were greatly expanded by   and  . East met West in a   of where to draw the line between   and  , with significant Kara-Turan expansion by BadCatMan. Meanwhile, Lhynard added a   feature to the wiki.\n January 2017 rolled around and the wiki had grown to 21,352 articles. The admins and editors wrestled with canonicity questions about  ,  , and DMs Guild publications.   joined late in the year and immediately began fleshing out the  , eventually completing the set in 2018. She and other prolific editors pushed the wiki page count to 24,202 on January 1st of that year. While he was recording this statistic, Moviesign noticed that the wiki had over   page views that week\u2014a new milestone in FRW history\u2014followed quickly by hitting 25,000 pages on February 17th. Regis87 then moved on to  , building on previous work by BadCatMan.\n 2018 also saw the triumphant return (after a hiatus of nine years) of  , who dusted off his wiki skills and has been a fixture all year.   and Lhynard took to the stars on their  , greatly expanding the wiki's coverage of  , and somehow found time to add pronunciation ( ) guides to hundreds of pages (some of which contain audio of themselves demonstrating the correct form). Moviesign became the wiki's newest bureaucrat in July. He and Sir Whiteout used an astrolabe and some fancy math to compute the phases of   (currently full\u00a0 ).\n As of January 2019, the wiki had 27,359 pages. Moviesign promoted   to Admin status in March, primarily because he was already patrolling the wiki and upholding its standards, but also so he could speak with authority to outside entities. Among his many contributions,   made it easy for the wiki to support both English and SI units with a set of smart templates. He was promoted to Admin on October 11 of that year.\n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms_Wiki:About"},

They were also capitalized as the   or called simply  .  In the  , they were known as the   or   or  , all meaning \"Creator Races\",  as recorded in at least one text, but it was unknown if this derived from a title the creator races gave themselves or a mistranslation by human scholars or its   author.  Either way, the term was not meant to carry honor or respect. \n Most historians agreed that the following races counted among the creator races:\n However, there was a long-running debate on whether the avians or   should be counted as the fifth creator race. Some sages included dragons and not avians,  such as   counting dragons among them in her  , while also terming the sarrukh as \"dinosauroid\".  That the apparent aearee statues reported by Captain Neidre, below, had both avian and draconic features did little to clear this up, suggesting they were either descendants of dragons or the ancestors of both dragons and avians. \n It should be noted that many more intelligent races lived on Abeir-Toril at the time, and that these were just the five greatest in the eyes of later scholars.  This may explain the unlikely inclusion of primitive humans,  though elves derided this;  the omission of   and  ,  who were apparently not known at this time;  and the exclusion of the  , who though present were not deemed great enough.   ,  ,  , and   were of course not counted as creator races and did not even appear in records or cave paintings of the time  because they, as well as some other human ethnic groups, came later from different worlds. \n The amphibioids were thought to have evolved in the seas, their growth mirroring that of the dinosauroids on land. When they became amphibious, they moved onto the land and eventually supplanted the dinosauroids. \n The sarrukh, batrachi, and aearee founded great empires on Abeir-Toril during the ancient epoch known as the Days of Thunder, beginning in approximately   and marking the point when recorded history began. They dominated the continent that would become   in succession over the course of five millennia. They spawned or created a plethora of lesser races and monsters. Through the  , they studied and recorded the magic of primitive races around them and recorded the knowledge in the items known as the  . Meanwhile, the fey did not establish an empire during these times, instead choosing to reign in Faerie, an otherworldly realm with only loose links to Faer\u00fbn. Those that dwelled in Faer\u00fbn's forests and woodlands did so in harmony with nature and hence had little impact,  while those in Faerie were believed by some to have become the progenitors of the elves.  Humans, while they were certainly present on Toril, did not rule at all.  While the very earliest human cultures began here, they did so under the dominance of the creator races, divided and ignorant of one another. \n In elven oral tradition and legends, these were the Days of Thunder, a time when immense empires of callous and inhuman reptilian, amphibian, and avian beings dominated the much warmer lands of Abeir-Toril. They were said to have erected towering cities of glass and stone, crisscrossed the wild lands with shining roads. They tamed the great   and experimented with the unrefined and unimaginably powerful   that existed at the time, commanding powers that rival  . But also they waged endless genocidal wars against one another in their mutual hatred, their mages launching blasts that annihilated armies and mountains alike. \n According to the elves, as befits their \"creator\" appellation, they toyed with creating new lifeforms and released them into the world\u2014even the most monstrous and mistaken and no matter how unnatural. Many perished in the jungles, but enough survived and they and the humans even evolved minds and learned of the gods. These lesser races wisely hid from the creators deep in the forests or in caves high in the mountains, and hence would outlive them all when their doom came.  Elven sages had many different theories about the creator races' sudden downfalls, but all accepted a swift climate change had rendered the world barely habitable to creator races and dinosaurs, and most thought it a catastrophe of their own making. The elves believed  ,  , and other deities first manifested during this time to aid the lesser races and foil the creator races.

A draconic or     was thought to have concocted a potent   that caused the fey civilization to break apart. \n Around  ,  the batrachi were losing a war against the titans and, in their desperation, enacted a great summoning ritual that unleashed several once-imprisoned  . The gods swiftly opposed the primordials.  The primordial  , the World Shaper, even hurled an ice moon or comet at the planet, in order to destroy what she could not have, in an event called the  . Disastrous earthquakes, fires, and windstorms swept across all of Abeir-Toril, erasing whole continents and rearranging the seas.

The basic campaign setting was divided between two game products:   a sourcebook describing character creation rules, equipment, and spells unique to the setting, and   a boxed set describing the land of Zakhara, with separate sourcebooks for the players and the Dungeon Master. \n There are a number of important concepts to the Zakharan culture including honor, family, social station, purity, piety, and hospitality. \n Zakharan society is broken into two main divisions:\n Zakhara's society is made up mainly of  , but demihumans such as   and   are present in the setting also, as well as humanoids such as  ,  , and  .

The partnership was subsequently joined by   and (temporarily) by  . When Don Kaye died of a stroke in 1975, Blume and Gygax, the remaining owners, incorporated a new company,  , of which Blume acquired the larger share. The assets of the original company were transferred to the new one, and Tactical Studies Rules was dissolved. In 1983, the word \"Hobbies\" was dropped from the name, resulting in the final name of TSR, Inc.\n TSR emerged as a leading developer of the modern role-playing game (RPG). Its flagship product,  , served as the model for the new field.   proved to be a financial success, and also was instrumental in developing the new RPG genre and introducing it to new market segments such as children and teens.\n TSR's games proved extremely popular, and extremely profitable. Gygax left for Hollywood to found Dungeons & Dragons Entertainment, which attempted to license   products to movie and television executives. His work would eventually lead to only a single license for what later became the   cartoon.  After Gygax's departure, Brian Blume and his brother   assumed control of the company. The Blumes were forced to leave after being accused of misusing corporate funds and accumulating large debts in the pursuit of spinoffs such as latchhook rug kits that were thought to be too broadly targeted.  Within a year of the ascension of the Blumes, the company was forced to post a net loss of 1.5 million US dollars, resulting in layoffs for approximately 75% of the staff. Some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies such as  ,   and to work with Coleco's video game division.\n Gygax, who at that time owned only approximately 30% of the stock, wrote to the Board of Directors, asking them to remove the Blumes as a way of restoring financial health to the company. In an act many saw as retaliation, the Blumes sold their stock to  .  Gygax tried to have the sale declared illegal; after that failed, Gygax sold his remaining stock to Williams and used the capital to form  .\n Williams was a financial planner who saw the potential for transforming the debt-plagued company into a highly profitable one. However, she disdained the gaming field, viewing herself as superior to gamers.  Williams implemented an internal policy under which playing games was forbidden at the company.  This resulted in many products being released without being playtested (some were playtested \"on the sly\") and a large number of products being released that were incompatible with the existing game system.\n Through Williams' direction, TSR solidified its expansion into other fields, such as magazines, paperback fiction, and comic books. Williams controlled the Buck Rogers license and encouraged TSR to produce Buck Rogers games. TSR would end up publishing a board game and a role-playing game. \n During this time, in the early 1980s, TSR developed the   series, which consisted of an entirely new game world and rules. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman also produced a trilogy of novels set in the   universe, which became the first game company fiction to reach the Best Seller list in the United States. During the height of its success, TSR made an annual profit of over one million U.S. dollars, and maintained a staff of 400 employees. \n However, TSR gradually lost its ability to innovate.  After the emergence of collectible card games, TSR released several new collectable game lines:   and  . Neither found great success in the market place. At the same time, TSR began retaliating against fan fiction and other creative work derived from TSR intellectual property, which angered many long-time customers and fans. Other new entrants into the RPG genre introduced competing fantasy worlds, which fragmented the RPG community, further reducing TSR's already wilting consumer base. These and other factors led to TSR ending accumulating over $30 million in debt by 1996, and having to endure multiple rounds of layoffs. \n With the decline of TSR,  , publishers of the wildly popular collectible card game  , inherited the title of \"Lord of the RPGs\". Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR and its intellectual properties in 1997, ending the company's slow fall from grace.  TSR employees were given the opportunity to transfer to Wizards of the Coast's offices in Washington; some accepted the offer. Corporate offices in the Lake Geneva office were closed. Over the next few years, various parts of the company were resold to other companies, while in 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by  . In 2002, Gen Con was sold to Peter Adkison's Gen Con, LLC.  Also in 2002 TSR's magazines were transferred to  .  The TSR brand name continued for several years, then was retired. Soon after, TSR trademarks were allowed to expire.\n TSR's main products were role-playing games, the most successful of which was  . However, they also produced other games like card, board and dice games, and published both magazines and books.\n In 1984, TSR started publishing novels based on their games. Most   campaign settings had their own novel line, the most successful of which were the   and   lines with dozens of novels released in each.\n TSR also published the 1995 novel   by Martin Caidin, a standalone reimagining of the Buck Rogers universe and unrelated to TSR's   game.\n Over the years, TSR published a number of fantasy and science fiction novels unconnected with their gaming products, such as  ' \"Red Kings of Wynnamyr\" novels,   (1991) and   (1992) and  's five \"Gabria\" novels ( ,  ,  ,   and  ); but never devoted a major portion of their budget or energy toward becoming a major publisher in the field.\n After its initial success faded, the company turned to legal defenses of what it regarded as its intellectual property. In addition, there were several legal cases brought regarding who had invented what within the company and the division of royalties. These actions reached their nadir when the company threatened to sue individuals supplying game material on Internet sites (illegitimately, as under special circumstances U.S. copyright law holds that guidelines and rules may not be copyrighted).  In the mid-1990s, this led to frequent use of the nickname \"T$R\" in discussions on RPG-related Internet mailing lists and Usenet, as the company was widely perceived as attacking its customers. Increasing product proliferation didn't help matters; many of the product lines overlapped and were separated by what seemed like minor points (even the classic troika of Greyhawk, the Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance suffered in this regard).\n In addition, TSR's corporate culture tried to convince its creative staff that the company was their only refuge for employment.  In response, ex-employees banded together in a loose organization called \"CTHULHU\" (Confederation of TSR Hirelings Undaunted by Leaving the Hideous Uglyheads).\n The company was the subject of an urban myth stating that it tried to trademark the term \"Nazi\".  This was based on a supplement for the Indiana Jones RPG in which some figures were marked with \"NAZI(tm)\".  This notation was in compliance with the list of trademarked character names supplied by Lucasfilm's legal department. Later references to the error would forget its origin and slowly morph into stories of TSR's trying to register such a trademark.\n  also supplied a list of trademarked Marvel characters which included the term \"NAZI(tm)\".\n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/TSR,_Inc."},

The 3rd edition rules were eventually revised in 2003, and version 3.5 was released.\n  4th edition was published in June 2008 with completely revamped gameplay mechanics, combat rules, and magic system. This shakeup of tradition received mixed reviews.\n On January 9, 2012,   announced that they had begun work on   5th edition . The 2012 D&D Experience convention (January 26 - January 29) was held in Fort Wayne, Indiana, during which hundreds of convention goers got a first look at the concepts behind D&D 5th edition.\n On July 15, 2014, the   was released in a box with booklets for the Dungeon Master and the players, pregenerated characters, six dice, and an adventure for levels 1\u20135.

They drew upon   through a broad range of   and other   abilities learned through years of practice and training.  Through the spells they prepared and memorized, powerful wizards could take control over a battlefield,  commanding fire and lightning as easily as others wielded sword and shield. They could learn and perform intricate   of arcane power that drew in entities from across the   or peer into future potentialities that have not yet come to pass. \n \n Wizards were generally the best-respected of all arcane spellcasters. They usually maintained a measure of discipline that was uncommon among   or  , whose very nature made them comparatively unruly. Not all wizards were deserving of this reputation however, and wizards were corrupted by their power or otherwise turned to evil ways. \n Prior to the  , wizards as a whole were associated with  , Goddess of Magic and manifestation of The Weave.  That closely held association was altered for a time following Mystra's death during the  .   , Goddess of Darkness orchestrated Mystra's death and attempted to supplant her arcane plexus with the  , but was ultimately unsuccessful.  During the  , both Mystra and the Weave returned to  , and the relationship between them and arcane practitioners was restored. \n Wizards had access to a wide variety of   available to them, fueled by the arcane energy of the Weave.  A wizard's spells differed from those of other arcane spellcasters usually in terms of usage or scale. They could control the nature of a battle, completely alter a landscape, or even the physical makeup of the universe itself.  They learned new spells by reading over and in some cases even building upon the arcane research of others. \n They were also skilled in the use of  , powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast. Like other spells, wizards kept inscribed the specifications rituals written within their  , where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual.  \n One point that marked wizards as different from other arcane spellcasters was their reliance upon their arcane spellbook. In order to  , wizards studied their spellbook before they planned to rest, sleep,  or in the case of   enter into  .  Once their spells were prepared, wizards could access and cast them to the extents their mental capacity would allow.  \n Wizards were entirely dependent upon their spellbooks to prepare new spells each day, and could barely tap into the Weave without them. The only spells that wizards could cast without preparation were simple  . \n When casting spells, wizards often used  , or  , such as  ,  , or  .  These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as   and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically. \n A   was a normal animal that gained new powers and became a magical beast when summoned to service by a wizard or a  . Each wizard shared an empathic bond with their familiar and could even channel the casting of certain spells through them. Many types of animals could be called upon as familiars, from everyday   and  ,  to more exotic species such as   and  . \n Mastering, and even learning the basics of the Art was a long and arduous process. The most straightforward method was apprenticeship under experienced mages. However, it was not an easy task. It required thoroughly learning and using spells starting from the most basic spells of everyday utility, such as   or  . Adventurers and other thrill and fortune seekers trained in the Art by successfully reading out   or by methodically learning, copying, and replicating arcane writings, all the time slowly improving their experience. Lastly, learning the Art was accessible through natural-born strong \"wild talent\" or a \"Gift\" that aided mages-to-be in the learning process. \n Youths of humble means rarely became wizards as the learning the Art was an expensive aspiration. This one of the reasons why wizardly profession was so scarce in the Realms. Those of talents and luck became apprentices, or drudges to mages, while those in the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr tried to demonstrate their \"Gift\" to the infamous   or another well-known arcane organization. An alternative to service to apprenticeship were the Harpers who covertly scouted the Realms for goodly youths with the \"wild talent\". \n \n Wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. In particular, they learned most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their  . Unlike   or sorcerers, the wizardly method allowed them to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards saw themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, and scientists, studying a system of natural laws that are for the most part unknown and undiscovered.  \n Resting: Wizards were forced to rest prior to spell casting,  by getting uninterrupted hours of restful sleep or meditation. \n Preparing: In order to prepare spells from their spellbooks, wizards needed comfortable quiet areas to study. The spell was read, spoken, or memorized up until the trigger. \n A wizard still in his apprentice stage. During their studies, wizards chose arcane traditions to follow, most often preferring to focus upon a single  .  Other wizards, known as  , were less inclined to specialize in the various schools of magic. These individuals instead prefer to use a wide variety of spells, with no limitations on which spells they can or cannot cast other than lack of knowledge. \n Wizards could choose to specialize in one or more of eight schools of magic, a distinction that was made early on in their training.  This specialization was sometimes required in order to join the ranks of some of the world's most prestigious wizards. The   of   required all initiates to be specialized in one of the schools of magic. \n Specialists were generally treated by the world at large as non-specialized wizards were, albeit with some notable exceptions. Entertaining  , highly-prized  , and often-maligned   were often regarded differently than other practitioners.  While it was uncommon, some  ,  , and   even practiced  , exclusive specialization in two opposing schools of magic, to the exclusion of all others.  Nonetheless, specialists were  simply considered wizard variants by the magic casting community as a whole. \n Wizards that specialized in   magic, those that deflected others spell, banished entities, or otherwise protected individuals, were known as  .  These wizards were usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. Abjurers liked to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devoted their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters. They were not considered threats to most martial combatants, but were deadly threats to practitioners of arcane or   magic. \n Because of their propensity for deliberant action, adjurers tended to be ethically sound and morally upstanding individuals. There were however other practitioners of the school that were drawn to its practice by the promise of greater power. Many abjurers only reluctantly took up the life of adventure and were most often found in small villages where they enjoyed the trust and good regards of friends and neighbors. \n  were wizards that specialized in  , the magical art of summoning creatures and items, as well as manifesting teleportation.  Conjurers were often headstrong and disdainful towards other schools of magic, seeing most as weak or inconsequential, or in the case of necromancy, wholly repulsive. Conjurers can be difficult companions since many are so independent-minded that only an unusually strong-willed leader can earn their respect. \n According to some stereotypes, conjurers lacked the finesse of other specialists and viewed magic as a blunt instrument. They were often overconfident in battle, believing themselves capable of overcoming any threat. It was said they often favored quick and easy solutions over careful planning advocated by abjurers. Conjurers tended towards moral ambiguity, were unbothered by ethical conventions, and were quite willing to acquire power by unsavory, evil or outright despicable methods. In order that they could conduct experiments and arcane research in peace, conjurers often preferred isolation over collaboration with others. \n Those wizards who specialized in  , the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or a far away location, were known as  . Their abilities were highly prized among everyone across the Realms, from monarchs to paupers alike.  Diviners were notable for their intuition and prudence, preferring to use violence only as a last resort. Many diviners were also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all matters. They were not cowards by any means, but preferred to exhaust other options before resorting to violence. In battle, their magic proved extremely potent against illusionists, whose tricks they could unravel with their own spells. \n Because of their deliberate approach to matters, most diviners abided the law but generally remained neutral on matters of morality. Diviners of all stripes often made good money seers or fortunetellers. They did not however often become adventurers, in part because of their solitary nature, but were highly valued and readily welcome within most adventuring parties. Benevolent diviners used their foresight to prevent harm from coming to others while malevolent practitioners often used it obtain control over others.  \n  were those wizards that specialized in the school of  , the arcane art of influencing or controlling the actions of others. Many enchanters were known to be very charming, with naturally outgoing personalities that were attractive to many they encountered. This natural charisma was not required by enchanters however, as they could sway the opinions or actions of others with their magic. Even the most boorish or repulsive enchanters had to draw upon their intellect first and foremost. They utilized their spells to overcome social obstacles, nullify opponents in battle, or even turn their enemies into allies in the midst of combat. \n An enchanter's tendency to work with allies more closely than other wizards was one of their greatest strengths. Enchanters of all kinds enjoyed good company and were typically more often found in large cities than small insular communities. They did not overly concern themselves with concepts like   or  , but tended to be more free-spirited when it came to following laws. The major difference between enchanters arose when they were forced to decide whether or not to violate the free will of another living being: some had qualms and would not take such action, while others did so with little to no concern. \n  practiced a unique blend of arcane magic with the elemental power of creation, from the   school of magic. They were found in all walks of life where arcane power proved an important edge, from small-time bandits to grand armies that employed them as arcane artillerists.  Due to their natural skill in magical warfare, these wizards were among the most valued combatants in warfare.  They wielded offensive spells that could blanket a battlefield in destruction, while simultaneously sculpting it to spare their allies.  \n Practitioners of evocation were often decisive, forthright, and stubbornly determined individuals; qualities that were associated with strong leadership. They seldom let distractions into their lives, preferring austere lifestyles with few creature comforts in contrast the magnificent powers they commanded. Evokers held no strong disposition towards the forces of good or evil, nor law and chaos in the world. \n  magic were among the most well-known specializations of wizardry, and the   who practiced it were often beloved as entertainers across the Realms.  Their magic inspired wonder and kindled the imagination of audiences far and wide.  They were often extremely flamboyant and outgoing individuals, with a streak of outright hedonism. Considered among the most creative of arcane practitioners, most illusionists were great appreciators of the arts and hands-on experimentation, while were less concerned with scholarly research. While they were just as intelligent and skilled as other wizards they were not always as reflective, often accepting life as an impermanent existence that was best left free from uncompromising philosophies. \n They were not however mere clowns or conjurers of cheap tricks, but could be deadly adversaries when they so chose. They employed illusions to toy with their enemies, casting illusory images or sounds to befuddle the minds of their foes and turn their senses against. In some instances, these illusions were so powerful and realistic they \"fooled\" enemies into injury and even death.  Illusionists that chose malevolence could be truly frightful and menacing. \n  and its   practitioners concerned themselves with arcane mastery over the forces of life and death, along with the existence of   in between. They wielded the actual life energy that permeated all of existence as other wizards created simple facsimiles of life or viewed potentialities that did not exist.  Most necromantic wizards approached life with a stoic and thoughtful attitude and was misinterpreted by others. While some viewed them as withdrawn or obsessive, these wizards were often considered loyal and faithful companions by their allies. They were generally fearless towards death, which was appropriate considering their path often lead to mastery over its domain. \n For all their positive qualities, exposure to the forces of death and undeath corrupted many who delved into the necromantic arts. Selfish and even evil necromancers far outnumbered those that brought goodness into the world.  So-called   always focused their powers for the betterment of civilization.  While many of these wizards felt an allure to natural order, others possessed a more anarchic streak. It was extremely rare to find a necromancer that remained   to all matters of morality and ethics. \n  was the school of magic that focused on altering both energy and matter to the whim of the   who specialized in the art. These wizards saw the universe as wholly mutable, full of variables and configurations that they delighted in exploring.  They tended to be a bit more curious than other wizards, marked by a fascination in how forces and things fit together and likewise, could be taken apart. As such many transmuters were ardent collectors of magical items and  . While they thought clearly and in-depth about the machinations of existence, they often lacked insight into   things were rather than just   they existed. \n Many transmuters tended toward unpredictability and disorder, as chaos remained the very essence of change. There was not much shared moral outlook upon their numbers, but rather different perspectives on how their abilities could be used to change the world. Transmuters were more adventuresome than other wizards and can often be found exploring the world.  They made for skilled   and often crafted   that could be used to alter characteristics about anyone that held it. \n While all wizards held access to the eight schools of magic, some preferred to follow other arcane traditions beyond school specialization. \n The   art of bladesinging was a closely-guarded secret of the  , limited mostly cities of  ,  , and  . The   itself was an elaborate series of stances and maneuvers resembling a dance, which allowed a wizard to perform exceptional feats in combat. Experienced bladesingers learned to attack more quickly in combat than other wizards, delivering twice as many blows in the span of mere moments. \n Despite what is name suggested, bladesingers did not always wield   in combat. Different   utilized hafted weapons such as   and  , which others incorporated   or chained weapons such as  . Regardless of their preferred weapon, bladesingers were nearly exclusively recruited from among elves and   of the Realms. \n \n War mages (not to be confused with the well-known   of  ) were specialized wizards that focused on battlefield applications of their spells. Many of their spells originated from the evocation or abjuration schools of magic.  To ensure their own survival, war mages first learned how to deflect attacks by means of their arcane power. They laboriously studied battle tactics and trained themselves to make quick, decisive actions in combat. Over time, a war mage's magical offenses became more powerful and their defenses more durable. The most powerful of their ranks became juggernauts of destruction, redirecting attacks made against them towards everyone else on the battlefield. \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard"},

Having had few overt influences on the world's history but many small and unseen ones,  gnomes were often overlooked by the powers that be, despite their craftiness and affinity for   magic.  Gnomes were present in nearly every   city and most caravan-stop villages where other cultures and non-human races were at least tolerated. \n Gnomes were very small compared to most other races, with an average height of 3\u20320\u2033\u20124\u20320\u2033 (0.91\u20121.2\u202fm)  and a weight of 40\u201245\u202flb (18\u201220\u202fkg). Gnomes were generally larger and heavier than  , though   tended to be smaller than halflings, being 2\u20321\u2033\u20122\u203210\u2033 (0.64\u20120.86\u202fm) in height and 21\u201235\u202flb (9.5\u201216\u202fkg) in weight. This led some scholars to erroneously classify all gnomish races as \"smaller than the  \". \n While halflings were commonly said to resemble short humans, gnomes were more comparable with  , with whom they shared pointed ears and high cheekbones, or even  , due to their tendency to grow beards and live underground. Many gnomes had a more feral appearance than either, however, with hair that often sprouted from their heads in odd directions. \n The skin of gnomes ran in hue from reddish tans to earthy browns or even shades of gray, with exact hue somewhat dependent upon the ethnic origin of a gnome. Similarly, gnomish hair varied wildly in color from blond and brown to more exotic colors like white, orange, or even green. Gnomish eyes were often\u2014particularly in individuals who were native to the  \u2014glittering black  or blue,  although more natural eye colors were also known to the race. \n In terms of clothing, gnomes often preferred those with earthen tones or made of leather. They similarly preferred jewelry with earthen tones. \n Gnomes were an intelligent  and innately curious race. Gnomes might have lacked the drive and ambition of other races, particularly  , but their creativity gave them a strong ability for ingenuity. Most gnomes were content to live simple lives, acquiring knowledge merely as a hobby but others explored lost ruins, delved deep into the heart of the world, and conducted dangerous research in their unquenchable thirst for knowledge, leading more than a few to an untimely demise. \n Gnomes were naturally witty and jovial, and they preferred to overcome obstacles through cunning and innovation rather than the obvious way. Ever curious, gnomes were drawn to adventure more often by a desire to see the world than out of greed or the hope of fame. It was this curiosity, along with their cunning and witty repartee, that made gnomes both entertaining friends and adept   or scholars. \n Most gnomes loved  , particularly  , but they were not avaricious. The gnomes that most people encountered were content to raise  , grow  , and live a life of honest hard work. \n Gnomes who left home to seek an  's life were rare, given the race's famed shyness and lack of ambition.  Those that did were motivated by a number of factors, but the impulsive race was often driven by curiosity more than anything else. Many gnomes felt no more rationale for adventuring than simply to explore the world that surrounded them. A few, the more orderly ones that is, sought out adventure for more innately noble purposes, such as to help others, but these gnomes were rare. Other gnomes were driven to become adventurers by little more than simple avarice, as adventuring was often seen as a quick, if unsafe, avenue for wealth. Adventuring was not necessarily a welcomed lifestyle among gnomes, despite the curiosity that filled the whole race, and sometimes was, in fact, seen as a betrayal of sorts to a gnome's clan. \n In the  , gnomish adventurers were sometimes known as \"fastpaws\". \n Gnomes were a naturally intelligent and creative race, with a charm about them unusual for other humanoids. Gnomes also had a strong affinity for all things  . In particular they had a natural grasp of the  , innately possessing the ability to cast the     and some possessed the ability to cast   and   as well. Gnomes also had a natural affinity for stealth, an affinity they could sometimes pass on to others,  and illusion, both for the purpose of using it for themselves as well as seeing through other attempts at it. After the  , gnomes innately were able to use the   power to disappear temporarily from sight and additionally had a reflexive tendency to take cover and hide when suddenly endangered.  Some gnomes learned also to combine their   ability with   like that of an eladrin.  Other gnomes were capable of casting  . \n Gnomes were talented  , with a natural grasp of the arcane. Regardless of their other talents, all gnomes were capable of casting a cantrip or two and had the capacity to disappear from sight if they wished. Gnomes were well-suited to all forms of arcane training, particularly that of a  ,  ,  , or  .  They were the only non-elven/half-elven race capable of becoming   specialist wizards; in their case,   ( / ). \n Gnomes were known to wear a wide range of armor and   types into combat. Including  ,  ,  , and  . In terms of weapons they most commonly fought with  ,  ,  ,  , and  . \n \n Like other races, gnomish culture varied based on region and ethnicity, but a few characteristics were common to most gnomes. Among virtually all gnomes, great value was placed on one's ability to avoid trouble and stay out of the way of others. Children's games often involved elements of stealth and, among adults, drawing attention to one's self was considered a breach of etiquette.  Most gnomes tried to remain inconspicuous and quietly left the scene of a fight.  The few legends of gnomish heroes were not of powerful warriors but of subtle tricksters, who sneaked past or tricked their opponents rather than vanquishing them in combat. This in part came from the long-standing issue gnomes had faced, namely their miniscule size compared to larger predators or enemies such as the   of the Feywild, whom few gnomes could hope to stand toe to toe with in a fair fight. \n Gnomes had an intricate society based on their love of all kinds of arts, pranks, and their long lives. Gnomes loved indulgence, and they made most celebrations on a grand scale. \n Gnome weddings lasted for a week, even though gnomes didn't view love the same way humans did. If love began to go wrong between a couple they might break up, believing it was simply a prank by  . \n Their society was based on art; almost all gnomes took up some form of art, whether music, painting, cooking, building, or any other form that was considered creative by the time they came of age, or else they sponsored others. \n When living among other races, particularly humans, in an urban environment, gnomes were often shopkeepers or worked as everyday blacksmiths (leaving the fancy armor and weaponsmithing to the dwarves). They also worked with  ,  ,  , and  , casting and etching practical household items.  Other occupations included gemcutters, mechanics, sages, or teachers, the last in particular being a highly valued profession by human employers, who knew that a single gnome could tutor multiple generations. \n In the  , as well as some places on  , gnomes typically lived in earthen burrows and dug-out homes akin to those used by  ,  , or  . As such they were fond of these small animals, feeling a sense of natural kinship with them. And much like these animals, gnomes had an aversion to danger that made them naturally inclined to hide away if able. Thus many gnomish homes were carefully hidden by magic or other methods. \n Gnomes most often liked to keep badgers,  , and   as guard animals in their lairs. \n Gnomes primarily lived in wooded, hilly landscapes, most often underground.  They typically built earthen homes with cellars and escape tunnels. Above-ground structures were often round and made of stone and thatch.  Generally speaking, though, gnomes enjoyed the fresh air a good deal more than other subterranean races such as dwarves or drow and rarely burrowed very deep, spending a great deal of time on the surface. Gnomish homes or communities were generally well-hidden, making it difficult for unwelcome visitors to find them. Within, gnomish houses were warm and comfortable, akin to the burrows of small mammals. \n Gnomes were found widely throughout the world, though rarely in large numbers. Small communities were most commonly found in the  ,  , and along the coastline of the  . Other gnomes, notably the svirfneblin or deep gnomes, were found in the Underdark and were even more secretive than other gnomes, maintaining their distance from other races except for dwarves, with whom they were careful to maintain polite relationships for the purpose of protection. \n The majority of gnomes were found in  , the only land in which gnomes lived in great numbers and the closest they had to a homeland.  However, during the disaster of the  , the island was swept clean. \n The Feydark was home to a large number of gnomes. Their physical appearance differed from their surface-dwelling cousins, having larger eyes and skin so pale it appeared almost translucent. Feydark gnome culture was also quite different from that of surface-dwelling gnomes. They were known for their violent tendencies and gallows humor, while madness and savagery were considered positive personality traits. Feydark gnomes were also extremely xenophobic. \n The primary gnome   of the   was  . Other deities of the pantheon were  ,  , and  . These gods were all themselves, at least after the  , members of the  , the fey pantheon headed by  . \n Gnome funeral rites often employed cremation. It destroyed the body, (preventing desecration), and released the spirit to find its own way. \n Most gnomes spoke   as well as their own language,  .  Some were known to be capable of speaking  ,  ,  , and  . Others were even said to be capable of speaking with burrowing mammals. \n Gnomes, in general, were a reclusive people who'd rather stay out of others' affairs. Though some races interpreted this as cowardice, it's more the case that gnomes simply had nothing at stake in the conflicts between most other races and after centuries of being ignored or stomped on, were not particularly eager to fight someone else's fight. In fact, generally speaking, gnomes were a very courageous and good-hearted race, who frequently used their neutrality as a way to negotiate disputes. Of all the races in  , it's fair to say that gnomes had the fewest enemies, although they had very few friends as well. \n Gnomes rarely intentionally invoked ire in any group, but at times circumstances made conflict with other races unavoidable. In the  , gnomes were particularly wary of the fomorians that sometimes enslaved them, regarding them with fear and caution. In the  , gnomes were most often at odds with   and  , who shared their underground homes and often war with them for territory or wealth. In these cases, gnomes were rarely the aggressors, owing to their tendency to avoid trouble rather than cause it. \n Gnomes were on fairly good terms with other fey, being particularly fond of eladrin, though they also shared good relations with elves. Gnomes also had sympathy for the fey commonly enslaved by fomorians, feeling empathy for creatures that shared the fate many of their forbears had suffered. Gnomes also got along well enough with halflings. \n Among those gnomes who lived in the caverns of the Prime, dwarves were often counted as friends, due in part to the two races' physical and cultural similarities. Additionally, dwarves and gnomes both counted goblins and   as enemies and could often be found working together against them. Gnomes were generally suspicious of other races, however. \n Gnomes produced distinctly-colored glass items. Gnome glass was green like impure   and translucent. This hue was a result of the gnome crafters melting and reshaping glass. Gnomish green glass cups were a commodity found throughout the Realms. \n Many gnomes were weak compared to other humanoids, though this was far from a universal trait for the race. Like elves, gnomes had sensitive hearing and were often capable of hearing things that other races might miss.  Gnomish eyes were also suited for seeing in low-light conditions, to a degree comparable with elves or eladrin. \n Gnomes were also very long-lived, often living as long as elves, which meant living over three centuries was not uncommonly rare and five centuries was not unheard of. Generally, gnomes were considered to reach maturity at forty years of age.  However, unlike elves or  , gnomes showed a greater degree of aging as they grew older and once a gnome had passed his or her first century, their hair began to gray, if it was not already white, and their skin began to wrinkle as in humans or dwarves. However, even the oldest gnome retained a vitality that would be extraordinarily unusual among many of the younger races. \n There were several subraces of gnomes, as listed below:\n Throughout time gnomes maintained a rich oral tradition, but largely lacked a recorded history and they were rarely mentioned in the historical texts of other races. Because of this, it was unknown when exactly gnomes first emerged on Toril and migrated across Faer\u00fbn.  One historical text notable for discussing them was the  , which held that gnomes were created in approximately   from gems hidden in caverns beneath a mountain in the land later known as  .   enslaved the first gnomes and stole the gems that contained yet-unborn gnomish souls. This prompted   to collapse the mountain, killing most of the kobolds (including their leader  ) and creating the depression known as the  , later as the  . \n Gnomish myths held that the gods of the gnome pantheon originated as gems deep within the bowels of the earth that were then exposed to open air.  Likewise, these myths held that the gnomes were created when Garl Glittergold discovered similar gems and breathed life into them, which he followed up with a joke, inspiring the race to craftiness and mischief. This story also related that gnomes born of   became the  , while those forged of   became   and those made of rubies were the ancestors of the  . \n Beyond the  ,  the known history of gnomes began in the  . During this period they had developed their knack for creating intricate constructs, a trait that would be refined over the generations, and were known to have building skills that could rival dwarves of that time. They typically lived under either peasant or slave conditions,  with many forest and rock gnomes being held captive by the nations of Netheril and   as slaves.  For the Netherese, the first gnomes to be enslaved were rock gnomes from nearby hills in  .  That same year the Netherese, allegedly inspired by the evil Gnomish god Urdlen, began conducting experiments with magic to warp their gnome slaves into what became known as  ,  though by some accounts this offshoot race did not appear in the Realms until much later. \n The \"Time of Bondage\" as this period became known,  lasted for centuries in Netheril, with the enslaved gnomes forced to act as craftsmen and inventors.  In return the Netherese gave them various tools, toys, and trinkets - all with the intention of furthering their productivity.  Many revolts would be attempted in Netheril, but were ruthlessly suppressed,  and both nations many gnomes would manage to escape.  Those who were lucky found refuge amongst the elven kingdoms that bordered Netheril,  such as   and  ,  while many other escaped slaves were eventually found and killed. The first instance of gnome refugees in the kingdom of Earlann was in  .  Comparatively fewer gnomes would make the trek north into  .  \n The elven nations would for a time house these refugees in the underground levels of the many frontier garrisons they had built to protect their forests,  a fact of history that would later be largely forgotten by all but the gnomes.  Fearing that they may incur the wrath of Netheril's  , the Earlanni eventually would shepherd their refugees further south of   with the aid of Cormanthyr. \n Many   would take a liking to the gnomish people  and go on to teach them the art of magic.  These early gnomish spellcasters found their people had an affinity for the illusion school of magic and its subschool   - due to the ongoing need to hide from their Netherese captors, a tradition of specializing in this aspect of magic would begin to develop among the gnomes. \n Around  , the   of Netheril, the   was created  through the joint efforts of gnome illusionists and Earlanni High Mages. A network of   crossings that linked together several elven fortifications,  the Trail of Mists would make it easier for escaped gnomes to flee from Netheril.  This system allowed slaves to easily move across  , as far south as what later became known as the   and as far east as the mountain range later known as the  . Most would choose to flee south, to the lands far beyond Netheril's sphere of influence.  Over time these successful escapes from slavery would inspire further revolts. \n The gnomish tradition of illusion magic was further improved upon around   by the elf  , who gained a deeper understanding of the school after glimpsing a stolen set of   within   and spread what he learned to the gnomes. \n It would not be until the latter half of the Silver Age of Netheril,  an age which commenced in  ,  that the gnomes would finally gain their freedom. Through a combination of stubborn refusal to work,  their newfound skills in illusion magic,  and the diplomatic efforts of Earlanni ambassadors.  Resistant at first to give in, Netheril's archwizards tried to use mind-controlling magics to keep the gnomes in line,  but this practice only proved to make them produce inventions that were of an inferior quality.  Netheril would finally relent in  , emancipating their gnome populace.  The gnomes that remained in Netheril would proceed to migrate south and east of what later became  , seeking to get far away from the Netherese. \n Some gnomes would immigrate to the  , settling in the   and  . There in the   of the Backlands and the   of Sunset Vale, forest and rock gnome communities respectively would be established with strong oral traditions, maintaining stories that told of their people's flight from Netheril and the challenges they endured along the way. It was also in these communities that the centuries of magical warping by the Netherese,  begun back in -3649 DR,  expressed itself with the emergence of an offshoot race known as spriggans. \n By the early  , a number of elves in   would joke that their gnome neighbors must have been descended from  , on account of viewing the traditional personalities and values they exhibited as a sort of blending of elven and dwarven attitudes. Some humans would misinterpret this as a fact, spawning a long lasting misconception that gnomes were a hybrid race.  \n As the Age of Humanity went on, gnomes stood apart from the other races who over the centuries continued to establish empires and waged terrible wars against their fellow man.  They chose to maintain a passive role from major events in the world,  scattering themselves across hundreds of secluded clans, holds, and villages  instead of coming together to found a homeland.  Though there were some exceptions to this, such as the island nation of   where gnomes and humans lived and worked together to achieve groundbreaking wonders  and the kingdom of  .  Over time some began referring to gnomes as the \"Forgotten Folk\", musing that they faded into the background of history whilst people of other races adventured, forged mighty legends, and were willing to challenge those in power. \n Some ancient gnome artifacts predating Netheril would survive well into the 14  century DR. However, despite this, some non-gnome sages would try to propose the erroneous theory that gnomes might have been created by   in an effort to make the perfect servile race. \n As the human population in Faer\u00fbn grew and gnomes became further marginalized, younger generations began questioning the wisdom of their forebears in taking a deliberately passive role in world events. This attitude was seemingly encouraged by the appearance of  , the god of invention, among the gnomes of Lantan during the   in  . As a result, a gradual trend emerged of more and more gnomes leaving their reclusive homes to travel the world.  Many rock and deep gnomes went on to take up the life of a  , seeking to uncover lost Netherese magic their fore-bearers had taken with them in their ancient emigrations from Netheril, in hopes to use such magic to bolster the position of the gnomish race. But along the way, such lorefinders uncovered many horrors thought lost long ago.  But as always, gnomes had an aversion to becoming a part of anything \"too big.\" Thus many others scattered into smaller, like-minded communities instead of attempting to direct larger ones. \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gnome"},

There were several types of dragons,  the most common of which were   and  , which were evil and good respectively.  They were an ancient race. Few species that still exist can claim longer lineage.  Dragons were the bane of the creator races of  ; their line was so old, they had their own realm during the first recorded exploits of the  .  In recent times, the dragons of Toril were nearly all recluses or at the very least secretive as to their true nature, living among other species in polymorphed form. \n The draconic family was vast. It consisted of numerous types of dragons, as well as lesser creatures related to dragons or descended from them. \n The term \" \" referred to dragons that became more powerful as they aged. \n These dragon types didn't fit into a single category.\n The term   referred to dragon-type creatures that did not become more powerful with age. It did not necessarily mean that they were less powerful than true dragons. \n Dragons were inherently magical beings, and in no case should dragons be considered reptiles, despite obvious similarities such as a scaled epidermis and reproduction by laying eggs. In fact, they were more akin to feline creatures than reptiles, particularly in regards to their posture and movements, as well as being inherently warm-blooded and with an eye composition similar to felines, although far more complex. A good example of this was the placement of the legs: dragons also tended to place their rear foot where their front foot was previously, much like most stalking feline predators. \n All dragons were omnivorous and could eat almost anything,  thanks to their innate elemental nature that allowed them to consume and digest all sorts of food, including substances that wouldn't qualify as food to other living creatures.  Most dragons preferred a carnivorous diet, but a few of them had developing unique dietary habits. Metallic dragons, for instance, preferred to eat primarily inorganic fare.  Although they were true apex predators, dragons were not above scavenging for food if necessary. \n The great \"spellwyrm\"   believed that each dragon had its own \"unique body chemistry\" so that their specific, individualized diet would effect their longevity, vigor natural proficiency for casting magic and proclivity for other activities.  \n Most dragons usually consumed half their own weight in meat every day. Dragons seldom got fat, as their bodies converted all the eaten food into elemental energy, storing it for later use. Much of this stored energy was expended using their   and when their bodies changed because of them advancing in age.  When eating inorganic materials, dragons needed to eat as much as its own body weight per day to maintain healthy bodies. \n In some instances, dragons also ate  . These instances were rare however. While dragons could \"inherit\" the magical properties of some magic items for a day or so, and as such this would have had some tactical value, few dragons would resort to do such a thing unless they were starving to the point of death. \n The number of eggs a dragon laid each brood depended on its race, but was usually low, between one and ten.  Evil dragons of adult age often laid and abandoned clutches of eggs, leaving the wyrmlings to work together to raise themselves until they were old enough to go their separate ways. Good dragons of adult age, and some more intelligent evil dragons, would form families consisting of the mated pair and their offspring. The children generally left the family by the time they reached young adulthood. As dragon couples got older, they became increasingly likely to split apart as the desire for treasure began to outweigh interests in families. Older dragons would continue to mate, but would assign a single parent to the duty of raising the offspring. \n Thanks to their shape-shifting, dragons could also cross-breed with virtually any other creature, creating a  . The most commonly heard of were in the humanoid races, particularly with   and elves. Any combination was possible, however, even with   or  .  Most of the time when dragons of different types crossbred it resulted in no offspring. Whenever offspring did occur between different types, the offspring's biology would almost always favor one of the parent's \"type\" over the other and might display characteristic that varied from its norm. In very rare instances of crossbreeding yielding offspring, the resulting child's biology might favor neither parent. This might result in them being born as a new type or with  . \n As for their senses, which varied slightly depending on the species, dragons were superior in most ways to other creatures - like any predator, they had exceptionally acute senses, which only increased with age.  Dragons had excellent depth perception and comparably good peripheral vision, able to see twice as well as a human in daylight; they had great night vision, and were able to see even when conditions had no light to offer, though not in color.  Dragons could also pick up scents very well, utilizing both their sensitive nose and forked tongue, much like a snake.  Their hearing was on par with human hearing, although their minds could filter what noise it hears.  Dragon taste was also refined, although they did not respond well to sweet flavors, and most dragons didn't discuss why.  They were able to eat almost everything, but each race had a preferred diet; some preferred flesh, other to eat precious metals or gems, and so forth.  Of all its senses, a dragon's sense of touch is the only one to decrease with age, due mostly to the development of thick, hard scales. \n Dragons were capable of blindsense, the sense in which eyes, ears, and other senses were used to detect invisible persons or objects. \n Dragons became stronger as they grew older; they also became larger, more resistant to damages and magic, had a more dangerous breath, and a great deal of other enhanced aspects. Older dragons could cast draconic magic, such as spells with just a few words, and oftentimes they didn't need long and complex ritual involving words, gestures and components like other  , and they radiated a mystical fear aura around themselves. After a millennium or two, a dragon reached his maximum development. \n All dragons had some innate magical abilities, but they varied from race to race. Metallic dragons were often able to shapechange into small animals or human forms, and used this ability to secretly help or watch over humans. Dragons also had some innate powers upon the element they are linked to. For example a red dragon, who breathed fire, had some control over other flame. \n All dragons also had a  , a supernatural ability to strike fear in those who saw them. Usually, dragons developed this ability after reaching the young adult age. \n All dragons were inherently territorial and covetous. They hoarded wealth\u2014although \"wealth\" could mean different things to different dragons\u2014and jealously protected their hoards. For most dragons, there was no such thing as enough treasure. They enjoyed collecting mountains of  ,  ,  , and magic items. They found these treasures radiant and enticing, and would make nooks and beds for themselves in their money piles. The habit of sleeping on their wealth meant that most great wyrms had hundreds of coins and gems embedded in their hides. \n Evil dragons are quick to attack anyone they perceive as a threat to their hoard, even other dragons. Good dragons are more likely to attempt diplomacy, but their desire to protect their hoard is no less intense. \n Dragons worshiped  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . The pantheon once included many other deities, forgotten after millennia of time, countless holy wars, and the deaths of all their living worshipers. Some dragons had even taken to worshiping human deities under different aspects. \n There were other, ancient gods of dragons, including   (also known as  ), although the nature of their being was not fully understood. \n The term \"wyrm\" was used to mean \"dragon\", but might also refer to a dragon within specific age criteria; see  . \"Wyrm\" was believed to have originated from  , the ancient language of the  .  The words \"wyrm\" and \"worm\" were pronounced similarly. Great care should be taken to avoid this as \"worm\" was the most insulting thing that one could call a dragon. \n It was not clear exactly how dragons came to inhabit  , but many traditions believed their origin was related to the  . Some scholars believe this event precipitated a dramatic climatic change, which in turn sparked the rapid evolution of   into the varied forms of dragonkind known today, while others claim that the dragon race was born from falling meteors that were actually dragon eggs.  \n Regardless of their true origins, in the few centuries that followed their arrival to Abeir-Toril,  the dragons generally kept aloof of the world's   and ignored them,  maintaining a relative peace with their nation  .  Though they regularly preyed upon the herds of animals the giants founded and tended, such as   and  .  This led to many minor conflicts with the giants,  as they felt slaying these poachers was not only desirable, but worthy of great honor  or \"bragging rights.\" Such conflicts, however, were always personal, not tribal or regional, with most being settled by contests of might, skill, or wits rather than outright murder. \n   , tensions between the two reached their peak and would erupt into  .  It was uncertain exactly what finally set off the war between them,  but by most accounts it was when the dragon god Garyx sent an   to lead a flight of red dragons to attack Ostoria.  An assault that led to the burning and destruction of a   city.  According to giants, this occurred because Garyx had inflamed those dragons with thoughts of greed and envy over Ostoria's prosperity. \n Despite giantkind's best efforts during this war, dragonkind ultimately drove them out of the southern portion of Ostoria.  The war eventually concluded with a truce, though accounts of the event and its nature differed among the races.  According to the giants, this occurred because of a game of   between Garyx and the giant god  ,  a game whose stalemate result granted the dragons continued ownership of the territories they had won in the war. \n However, according to the dwarves, the dragons ceased the war due to their own civil war developing between the chromatic and the metallic dragons,  known as the  , a conflict between the followers of Bahamut and Tiamat that continued unabated even in more recent times. \n Individual dragons and dragon clans came to rule large swaths of territory and battled with their rivals not only for dominion of those lands,  but also over matters of religious nature as the dragons of that ancient age were devout followers of their draconic gods.  This period of devastating warfare among the dragons led the race to near extinction.  Eventually, draconic philosophers came to the conclusion that all of the fighting was wasteful and that gods who allowed such behavior were not worthy of their worship. This started the dragon's apathy toward their gods, which lasted for thousands of years.  They also created the   to determine supremacy among them. \n Draconic rule came to an end when the elves created the  , a powerful magical effect that incited all dragons across Faer\u00fbn to madness and mindless destruction, turning against each other and even against their offspring. This event became known as the  .  Dragons were unable to take control of Faer\u00fbn again, their collective power waxing and waning over the following millennia. Although exceptions were recorded throughout history, the majority of Faer\u00fbn's dragons came to occupy the niche of top predator, not ruler. \n After the last Rage of Dragons, in  , the dragon population of   was greatly reduced in number.  That realization sparked the need of dragons to look for the help of their gods, marking the prophesied \" \", an ancient myth that foretold the return of draconic religious fervor.  The dragon gods who survived the long years without worshipers received a great influx of power from their new draconic followers. In  , a new \"Tearfall\" caused several new dragon eggs to fall from the sky. \n As dragons became free from the effects of the  , Faer\u00fbn was threatened with the possibility of a new  . \n The meat of a dragon was said to be similar to white   meat but with a much more intense flavor. When news of a fallen dragon got out, it often brought \"snatch teams\" to the site to carve up and transport the carcass to the nearest big city to be butchered and rendered into saleable parts. These teams were typically well-equipped and well-armed because the potential profit from such a windfall was tremendous. Any offer of meat billed as \"dragon tail\" (or any other part of the creature) was usually a ruse or a get-rich-quick scheme. The largest and best tasting   were said to come from the wings. This area of the body also yielded large slices of fat with the consistency of jelly. It was used to make fine stews when harvested in time, or as bait for   and other large carnivores and scavengers if not. \n  was valuable for crafting armor,  and the other inedible parts of a dragon had many uses, both   and mundane. The tendons from the wings were very strong and flexible, for example. Indeed, there were a few shops that specialized in dragon parts, such as the   in  . Some   claimed that properly prepared dragon organs, blood, or other fluids had magical healing or anti-  properties. The same sort of claims were made for alicorn (the horn of a  ) and for  -tail juice so it was often difficult to separate fact from fiction. \n Many spells could use dragon parts as  , such as:\n Powdered dragon bone was one of the components of the   created by the   of the   tribe and used by the   in the   against the  . \n While dragons knew how to whistle, the resulting sound was similar to nails or claws scratching a slate tablet. \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n :   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n : \u2022   \u2022  \n :   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   (  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  ) \u2022   (  \u2022  ) \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022       \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   ( ) \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon"},

At age 16, Akkabar was made the apprentice of the Vizera Wizard Princess   of  . He lived and studied in   with the queen for more than six years until his apprenticeship was over. He then moved to  , where he became a significant figure in the city's social elite after four years of selling his prestigious magical abilities to the highest bidder. After another six years of work, he managed to ingratiate himself into the royal court of    , quickly earning the right to marry the syl-pasha's   and, as a wedding gift, was granted the position of  -  of his home city  . \n Akkabar erected magical defenses around himself, his wife, and his home, while political strife, some of which he secretly instigated, resulted in the murders of his rivals. Within six months, he'd gained the throne of Calimshan, beginning his reign in  . \n Three years later, Akkabar's former tutor, Princess Rhynda, arranged to marry her grandson   to Akkabar's granddaughter   to stabilize relations between Tethyr and Calimshan. Despite objections from nobles on both sides of the border, they made the deal, and 4-year-old Arhymeria was sent to   for the court to foster as a lady-in-waiting. After she eloped with the king, Akkabar wanted to use the girl to steal Rhynda's magical secrets, but over the past ten years, Arhymeria had grown distant from her family. She refused her grandfather, becoming Rhynda's apprentice instead. \n Arhymeria and Nishan were both in their early 70s when Akkabar managed to arrange for pirates to murder almost the entire Tethyrian royal family, including his granddaughter, in the  .  King   of Tethyr was poisoned and succeeded by his nephew,  , at the bidding of his grand father, Akkabar. Following warfare in Tethyr, King Amahl II swore his fealty to Syl-Pasha Akkabar Shoon, cementing his rule over both Calimshan and Tethyr and marking the official founding on the Shoon Imperium.  \n Akkabar arranged for his grandson   to take the Tethyrian throne, but Amahl proved just as reluctant to be a puppet king as his sister was to be a thief. Unfortunately, he never married nor sired an heir, so Akkabar had Amahl poisoned and placed Amahl's nephew, also named  , on the throne of Tethyr. \n Amahl Shoon II didn't last more than 13 years before he died, and his son became   (reigned  \u2013 ). To ensure that his progeny lasted long enough, Akkabar spent the next dozen years at Amahl III's side, ensuring that he was protected and shared his vision. The precautions worked, though Akkabar died under mysterious and magical circumstances. Due to Akkabar's magical extension of his life and frequent deaths in his family, Amahl Shoon III was his closest living heir, and he inherited the throne of Calimshan. Now the king of both countries, Amahl crowned himself Qysar or \"overlord of kings\" over the \"Shoon Imperium.\" Amahl granted his youngest sister's husband governorship of Tethyr and moved his throne and the court to  . \n Five years after his reign as Qysar began, a coup was planned by three powerful Calishite noble families who were upset with the change in the status quo. They staged two \"hunting accidents\" that resulted in the deaths of three of Amahl's four sons. Paranoia and cruelty became the watchword for the rest of Amahl's reign. He became a recluse, emerging from the palace at Shoonach only once to announce his plan to dominate the lands around him. \n Five massive tidal waves struck Calimport, Memnon,  ,  , and   in the  . This led to the building of at least two temples to   in every coastal settlement. \n Upon his ascension to his father's throne, Amahl's son   (reigned  \u2013 ) began the royal line's tradition of being known only by their family name. He was an ineffectual leader, and history did not remember much of him. However, during his reign, the empire constructed several major roads. Intended to be used by the Imperium's armies, they would instead become significant trade routes. \n  (reigned  \u2013 ) was known for his persecution of priests, which stemmed from grievous personal losses that divine magic failed to prevent. He died without an heir and so adopted his newborn nephew on his deathbed. He also named his friend   (reigned as regent  \u2013 ) as riqysar until his adopted son came of age. \n But Hazamir was interested in something other than ruling the Imperium, preferring to concentrate on his magical studies. The army gained a lot of power from Hazamir's negligence, but they also conquered a lot of territory in the   and  . \n  (reigned  \u2013 ) was a spoiled boy, but he was also paranoid of losing the luxury he surrounded himself with. He ordered Hazamir's execution after deciding that he didn't trust him and spent his entire reign guarding himself against outside influences. So focused was he on those he didn't know that he failed to see the assassination attempt by his brother. \n  (reigned  \u2013 ) was primarily known for having people killed. Over 200 nobles, as well as countless others, died at his command. He descended into madness after only a decade on the throne, and his younger brother, two years later, justly killed him. \n  (reigned  \u2013 ) was the younger brother of Amahl III and Amahl IV and so had spent his life learning   and adventuring, thinking himself safe from responsibility. When he returned home, he found the qysar mad and, unable to stage a coup, confronted his brother. When Amahl IV attacked him, he had to slay him with his magic. A grateful populace immediately coronated him. Amahl V was an enlightened leader, restoring the rights of the clergy taken away by his uncle Shoon II amd sponsoring many impressive artistic works and the building of the   and an impressive   cathedral. His was a reign of peace, order, and prosperity. \n  (reigned  \u2013 ), the third grandson of the last qysar, was a warrior with a reputation for tough but fair leadership. A huge contrast to his predecessor, he only lasted for fifteen months and was remembered for one thing: putting down the slave rebellion known as the  . A scorpion sting killed him two days after returning to Shoonach from his campaign. \n  (reigned  \u2013 ) was a political genius, but he was also a  . These facts made him respected but also despised. The   grew exponentially under his reign, and trade prospered in the Imperium. Also, by allowing the demihuman realms of   and   to grow without his influence, they provided new, nonhuman ways of thinking that, once copied, benefited the empire greatly. However, his insistence on using   monsters in his armies greatly angered his generals,  although the use of undead, in an event known as the   in the  , did effectively put down the Tethyrian unrest that occurred in the lands between Ithmong and Shoonach.  In the  , Shoon IV seized control of the hoard of   and instigated intense magical research and experimentation among the mages of the Shoon Imperial Court. Many of the   and   of the Shoon Empire are from this time; one such example was the  . \n The Imperium was shocked when Shoon IV didn't survive the transformation into a  ,  and his great-granddaughter (whom he had named his heir merely as a formality) became the first unwed female ruler of Calimshan. Qysara   (reigned  \u2013 ) surprised her court by being almost as good a ruler as her predecessor. She limited the influence of spellcasters that had grown over the last qysar's reign and tirelessly sponsored the Imperium's armed forces. As a result, her armies managed to conquer fully half of the Shaar, the  , and some territory on the  . \n No one knew precisely how   (reigned  \u2013 ) became such a powerful wizard. However, when he replaced his mother on the throne after she died of a fever, he quickly began diverting resources to developing the Imperium's magical power. He allowed his mother's armies to act almost autonomously and left the rulership of the Imperium itself to several hand-picked, highly skilled vizars. He significantly improved the Imperium's intelligence network before being betrayed by his guard after only nine years on the throne. \n  (reigned  \u2013 ) killed his uncle's slayers to win the throne, though it was he who'd paid them to murder him in the first place. He quickly centralized the entire Imperium's power on himself, controlling nearly everything and delegating little. It would have been disastrous if he'd died, but he was such a demagogue that everyone who listened to him speak was inspired to loyalty, and so he avoided the assassin's blade. He was a harsh, blunt qysar who demanded loyalty through force from anyone who could threaten his power and believed that the ends always justified the means. When the merchant class complained about a recent drastic increase in crime, the qysar dumped oil into the   of every city in the Imperium, set it on fire with magic and burned the thieves out of their holes. However, the fires grew out of control, and more than three million of his subjects died as they burned the foundations and buildings of his cities away. Before the criminals could recover, Shoon had installed his loyalists to run most illegal enterprises for him. Shoon VII's reign saw the rise and fall of  , wherein a nazir of the Imperium, to impress his qysar, exponentially increased the size of the Imperium's borders all the way north to the  . Unfortunately, this drew the attention of  , which invaded Vashalar, defeated the nazir, and sent the Imperium's northern border back to the  . After sustaining injuries fighting with  , Shoon VII embarked on the path to lichdom.

These large, orb-shaped beings had ten eyestalks and one central eye, each containing powerful  . Powerful and intelligent, beholders were among the greatest threats to the world. \n Beholders were immediately identifiable, being essentially a floating head with one single,  -like eye surrounded by ten smaller eye stalks. Other than this, the main feature of a beholder's anatomy was its massive, gaping maw. Because of these features, beholders were occasionally known as \"spheres of many eyes\" or \"eye tyrants,\"  although the latter also referred to a specific type of beholder. \n Beholders of the Realms tended to be slightly larger than beholders found on other worlds, growing up to six feet in diameter where on other worlds they would average five feet wide. The majority of beholders living on Faer\u00fbn had skin colored in cool colors\u2014purples and blues\u2014on the top of their bodies that graduated into earth tones further down. Said skin had a pebbly texture. Most of Toril's beholders had nostrils and jointed, articulated eyestalks. \n Because their entire body was covered in eyes, beholders had the capacity to see in all directions at once, making it nearly impossible to ambush them while also giving them an unusually high degree of perceptive ability. Although beholders lacked the capacity to see color, they had the ability to perceive even in the most darkened environment, under conditions in which a   or similar creature would be rendered completely blind. \n Beholders were also capable of flight, in spite of their lack of wings or similar physical features, simply hovering above ground effortlessly. The effects of this flight resembled those of the      . \n Beholders were omnivorous, genderless aliens, and a subject of great fascination for sages who studied biology and the hunters who attempted to kill them. As such, a large amount of information was available on beholder anatomy.\n The skin of a beholder appeared to be made out of a stony substance,  as strong and durable as steel, and just as inflexible . Upon death, the skin would harden further into a stone-like consistency. \n Beholder 'bones' were incredibly porous and lightweight leather-like cartilage that was visually indistinguishable from their skin, but comparatively weaker, almost having the strength and durability of iron. Upon death, a beholder's skeletal structure would become brittle. \n Their eyestalks were usually flexible tentacles, but varied among individuals and could instead be jointed stalks covered in rigid chitin or segmented stalks similar to the bodies of earthworms .\n Not all beholders possessed nostrils, those who did could breathe like humanoids, those that didn't could only breathe through their mouths. \n A beholder's mouth was relatively similar to a humanoid's, but on a larger scale, containing soft palates, a muscular tongue and a row of upper and lower teeth (averaging 56 teeth in total)  lining a hinged jaw. Said teeth are long and thin however, designed for ripping and tearing rather than for chewing. \n Beholders had one lung, and two stomachs. \n Beholder blood was green.  Unlike a humanoid heart that pumps blood around the body constantly, beholders had a central 'blood sac' that, in conjunction with a powerfully muscled diaphragm, pushed blood into the beholder's blood vessels, then pulled the blood back into the sac. \n The beholder brain was similar in appearance to that of a humanoid's, but wider,  capable of reaching a diameter of up to 4\u202ffeet  (1.2\u202fmeters).  Its two lobes (known as \"dweomerlobes\") descended downwards to the left and right from the center like horns and had a complicated central nervous system surrounding it. The brain and nervous system was where magical energies were stored, amplified, and directed to the eyestalks.  It had been observed that older beholder's brains gained ridges. \n While they required, on average, about 10\u202fpounds  (4.5\u202fkilograms) of food and 2\u202fgallons  (7.6\u202fliters) of fluid per day,  an otherwise healthy individual could typically survive over twenty days without food or drink before dying of starvation or thirst.  Additionally, a beholder's digestive system was capable of storing excess consumed food to process as needed at a rate of 20\u202fpounds  (9.1\u202fkilograms) per day. For example, if a beholder ate 110\u202fpounds  (50\u202fkilograms) of food, only 10\u202fpounds  (4.5\u202fkilograms) of that would go towards its daily intake needs, and the rest would be digested over the course of the next five days without it needing to eat anything else.  A beholder could store at least 600\u202fpounds  (270\u202fkilograms) of food in its stomachs at any time. \n Food was liquefied in the beholder's two stomachs and pumped through a intestine-like system up to the lung where these intestines thinned out to a hair's breadth and mixed the food with air. The beholder's diaphragm pumped the digested food, combined with air from the lungs around the body through a system of fine arteries to nourish the organs. Waste liquid, devoid of nourishment and oxygen, would then drain back into the mouth to be expelled, or more likely dribbled out steadily. \n Beholders could eat just about anything organic, but they did have preferences. They tended to enjoy eating small mammals and birds alive (the combination sensation of soft flesh, crunchy bone and liquid blood in their mouths was considered a delicacy);  ; roast beef, lamb, and pork; liver and brain p\u00e2t\u00e9; insects; and leafy vegetables, leaves, flower petals, and exotic mushrooms. Their favorite drinks were blood, wine, and food coloring. Visually impressive meals were always preferred, particularly colorful ones (beholders often watched themselves eat with their eyestalks). They did not typically enjoy citrus fruits,  , or  ; eyeballs; hard-boiled  ; shellfish still in the shell; bull testicles; or anything fried in batter. \n Indigestible items eaten by a beholder would be either vomited up or absorbed into the body where it would eventually embed itself on the inside surface of the beholder's skeleton. \n The beholder's eyes were remarkable things. Hard, solid balls that drew in both light through the pupil and magical energy through the iris, which consisted of some sort of translucent crystal. The shape of the iris could be anything the beholder wished, which granted its owner both   and exceptional vision in the light\u2014beholders in a brightly lit space had been observed as capable of counting the legs on a minuscule insect at distances of over 120\u202fft  (37\u202fm). Beholder eyes also had up to twelve lenses, all capable of movement and rotation independent of the others, which was what granted them control over the aiming of their eye rays. \n Further inside the eye was a mass of nearly invisible strands called  . This nervous tissue transmitted both light and magic into the three retinas at the back of the eye. The retinas then transmitted the sensory signals and magical energy to the brain. When magic was needed to power a ray, the brain would send the magical energy back into the eye via the retinas. \n An unfortunate victim of the eyes of the beholder. Beholders gathered the energy that fueled their magical abilities by observing spell effects, magical creatures and items. Without new magic to look at, beholders could become very irritable, therefore they were driven to hoard magical items in their lairs and seek out magical places. \n Probably the least understood aspect of beholder biology was the antimagic properties of their central eyes. A beholder's central eye emitted a continuous antimagic field. Although careful squinting could narrow the area of the field generated, it would not stop unless the central eye's eyelid was completely closed, or the eye itself was put out or diseased to the point of uselessness. \n A lighter-than-air gas was produced inside the bodies of beholders. Some sages called this gas  . Tiusium would collect in chambers in the body, concentrated mostly at the top of the skull, thereby ensuring that individuals would rest in an upright position. A beholder would generate or expel the tiusium autonomically when it desired to ascend or descend. Three-hundred-sixty-degree tilting and horizontal movement were achieved through blowing air out of its lung via air vessels leading from its lung to its skin.   \n Beholders were considered adults at the age of two years old and retained their vitality until their 90  year. After that milestone, most beholders became increasingly frail and their abilities gradually ceased functioning as they should.  Most beholders died of natural causes between the ages of 120 and 150 years. Exceptions could be found in the   subrace of the species. \n At some point before the age of 40 years,  typically at the age of 30 years,  an egg-shaped womb swelled below the back of the beholder's tongue. This pregnancy caused extreme paranoia in the individual, until it got so bad that the beholder had to secret itself away in its lair until it gave birth. Prior to this, the beholder would consume up to four times the amount of food it normally would to create a great enough reserve, as eventually, after around four months of pregnancy, the womb swelled to a size too large to fit any food in its mouth. After just shy of six months of pregnancy, the beholder gave birth. \n The birth process had been witnessed by very few. According to those rare few witnesses, the beholder would unhinge its jaw, spit up its womb and bite it off. The babies inside would then have to chew their way out. A beholder brood was typically three to six babies, but could be up to twelve,  with newborns being almost always one-sixth the diameter of their parent. Newborns were birthed with the ability to levitate; possessed strong racial memories and an inherent ability to speak  , though their eye powers would develop later. \n The parent would choose one infant who looked most like itself to rear, and either eat or reject the remainder, forcing the survivors to fend for themselves. Since the birth process involved the destruction of the womb, beholders could only become pregnant and give birth once in their entire lives.  When the child that the parent chose to rear reached adulthood, it typically rejected its parent and left to become independent. \n Occasionally, a beholder, while sleeping, would warp reality with its subconscious mind and spawn a fully-grown beholder instantaneously out of nothing right there where it slept. If it was dreaming about itself, it may have created an exact duplicate of itself, otherwise it could spawn a beholder-kin or even a completely unique beholder-like creature.  The same dreaming could result in bodily alterations for the beholder. Each orb possessed an instinctual knowledge of one's body, and dreaming alterations were without limit. The same applied to beholders and beholder-kin created through dreaming. It was possible for a beholder to dream another creature into existence. However, for that to happen, the beholder had to possess intricate knowledge and understanding of another creature's bodily systems, generally achieved through years of studying, dissection, and selective breeding. Without such knowledge, only a misshapen mishmash of a creature could be dreamed to life. \n Beholders did not sweat or urinate.  They did defecate, but their stool, which could be up to six cubic feet in volume, would become almost indistinguishable from a natural sedimentary rock within two days. \n Beholders had a remarkable sense of sight, as mentioned. However, their sense of hearing was inferior to that of a human,  and their sense of taste was notably poor, if not nonexistant.  They primarily derived pleasure from eating based on the sight and texture of the food, rather than taste. One of the few things that beholders could enjoy the taste of was alcohol (though it took well over 10 gallons (45 liters) of wine before they would get drunk). \n Xenophobic and vicious creatures, beholders were quick to attack enemies, including anyone they deemed not \"like themselves.\" Beholders, as a rule, were violent and greedy, hungering for both wealth and power over others. This was made all the more complicated since more than one variety of beholder existed, each believing itself to be the pinnacle of bodily perfection and they viewed other beholders who differed from this image in even the most minute details as loathsome enemies and inferiors. \n Beholder minds were divided into two separate entities. Each of these entities thought and acted on its own accord even though it was bound to the same body as the other half of its mind. Neither half of the beholder's mind trusted the other, so they hid a lot from each other, creating a very paranoid relationship. \"Sane beholders\" were beholders whose minds were not \"divided\" so to speak. They were still two entities within the beholder, but neither hid anything from the other, making a less paranoid beholder. However, the persona of a \"sane\" beholder was just as likely to be considered insane by any non-beholder. Because there were two entities within a single beholder, that beholder should always be addressed by its full name when in conversation with them, or they would perceive it as speaking to only one of the entities. \n A beholder, and its antimagic cone. Beholders were not particularly strong but were inherently magical creatures, with each of their eyes possessing an innately magical nature. Beholders, who often attacked for seemingly no reason, would often try to end a battle as quickly as possible, unleashing their terrifying abilities all at once. Among the most basic of these attacks was their deadly ability to project magical power from their eyes, in varying forms such as instilling fear within, charming, knocking out, petrifying, disintegrating, slowing, or killing their enemies.  Any combination of these was possible, although they often used only two at a given time. \n Many, but not all, beholders also had the capacity to use their central eye to project a field of  , which canceled the effects of all supernatural abilities within a small cone of 150 feet in length. In addition to enemy  ,  , or similar effects, this also affected a beholder's own eye rays, suppressing their power. However, the inability to cast its eye rays at full strength was hardly a hindrance\u2014it allowed a beholder to attack its foes with its large, toothy maw. \n Beholders were often found occupying deep, underground caverns. Frequently, these lairs were carved out by the beholders themselves, using their eye rays to mold the environment for their purposes. Often, these lairs were built vertically rather than horizontally like most buildings, with beholder architecture frequently exhibiting a large number of vertical shafts which beholders and other flying creatures could use with ease, while walking creatures found their navigation hindered. \n Beholders worshiped   and the  . \n In spite of their hatred of diversity (or perhaps because of it), beholders came in a variety of forms, some of which are listed below:\n A vast number of beholderkin existed. Not true beholders, these creatures did not share the race's xenophobia, although most were still quite evil and cruel in nature.\n Beholders across Toril took part in an long-running and complicated game known as the  , competing against each other to accomplish extreme goals and venerate the  .  \n A beholder who wished to learn   of   beyond the simple use of its innate powers faced a number of limitations, the greatest of which being its own antimagic eyesight. However, some beholders were known to blind their own central eye in order to study  , becoming a beholder mage. The beholder then used its gouged-out eye as a   and was able to cast spells by   its eyestalks. To learn spells of a new level, a beholder mage had to permanently sacrifice the innate power of one of its eyestalks to dedicate to that new level. Doing this not only granted it access to more powerful spells but also negated the need for  . Furthermore, beholder mages were so innately gifted with magic that they could simultaneously cast spells with each eyestalk that had been dedicated to their arcane studies. In such cases, they handled the various conflicting   by singing a complicated spellcasting song. \n Beholder hide was a very rare and high quality crafting material, used in creation of armor and reinforcing weapons.  Beholder irises could be used to extract an essence that, when mixed with certain types of alchemical suspension, produced  . \n A few sages from the Realms maintained that the different subspecies of beholders had originally been created in the image of   from an unknown  , with the goal of traveling to different spheres and gathering as much information as possible. The beholders would traverse the   and learn about the secrets and current status of various worlds and then report back to their hive mothers, who would then gather and share what they had learned. However, as the beholders began visiting other spheres, the local deities grew fearful of their purpose and placed a number of   upon the entire species. As a result, the beholders forgot their original purpose and degenerated into the supremacist and paranoid creatures they would become best known for. \n It was believed that the knowledge station at the summit of the   on the planet   had been placed there by the beholder deities, so beholders could be reminded of their original mission. \n The   boss   kept a stuffed beholder in his treasure chamber on the   level in  . \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beholder"},

As of the mid\u201314  century DR it was rumored at the   rest somewhere within its ruins.  \n The city comprised four distinct districts,  and a vast underground network referred to as the Dwarven Dungeons. \n , also known as the \"Old City\", was the oldest ward that housed the city's austere civil buildings and estates of the noble elven houses.  Notable sites included:\n , or the \"Temple Ward\", was nearly as old as Cormanthor, housing many elven citizens and the temples of the  . \n , also known as the \"Lake Ward\", was home to the many businesses and guildhalls built around the tranquil  . \n , the \"Alliance Ward\", was constructed after the Opening in order to accommodate the non-elven residents that made their home in Myth Drannor. \n Landmarks outside the districts of Myth Drannor included the  , the north-most graveyard that contained numerous mausoleums and the  ,  and the  , an underground complex that housed much of the city's dwarven population. \n In the centuries following the city's destruction, various areas were left nearly unrecognizable from their previous state. The   swamp grew out of the beautiful public park and estate grounds of the   noble family,  while the magical fountain of healing that surrounded Castle Cormanthor devolved into the  . \n Landmarks that could be found within the ruins of Myth Drannor included the  , an especially deadly cluster or tangled trees formed by the residual magic in the city.  and the  , the site at which   wrote the introduction to her treatise on the holy books of the  .  In the years after the city's fall some new structures were still being erected as well, such as  , the Lathanderite that was built by the Seekers of the Dawn. \n During the height of its splendor, Myth Drannor was home to some of the most famous and knowledgeable of the Realms' residents.

During the late 15  century  , it was ruled by the      , along with the  , who were supported by a near-endless chain of bureaucrats and local  . The underpinning nature of Thay saw it engaged in an endless pursuit of   knowledge and power, a goal chased most ardently by the country's elite; such endeavours were fueled and expedited by rampant  , a practice woven into the tapestry of the country's long, dark history. \n For most of Thay's history, the country operated under a strict social hierarchy. The Red Wizards were considered the upper echelon of Thayan society, a magocratic noble class that was followed by   bureaucrats,  , merchants, soldiers, and mixed Mulan-  artisans and craftspeople.  Semi-skilled workers and common laborers were a mere step above the nation's great many slaves, a subjugated workforce made up of members of nearly every race within the Realms. \n In the years following Szass Tam's seizure of power in  , the Thayan people led hard, destitute lives.  It was a land whose governing philosophy held that   was a preferred state of being for its people, full of boundless possibilities and immeasurable power. During most of the 15  century the living had no means to achieve prominence within Thay, as their mere existence was an affront to the beliefs of the High Regent. \n To briefly escape the misery of life in the city, many Thayans sought more brutal forms of entertainment. Gladiatorial matches were common in larger cities like   and  ,  perhaps the only events that allowed commoners to succumb to their primal nature without fear of retribution from the upper class. The more ferocious and deadly combatants were celebrated by the throngs of spectators. The brutal   from Thay were considered the finest and most savage in all the Realms. \n The Mulani of Thay maintained their people's tradition of shaving their heads and what little body hair they had.  They were indoctrinated during their youth to revere the traditions of their people, obey the laws of Thay and honor those who served within the Red Wizards. Unlike the ethnic Mulani of Mulhorand, Thayans maintained a strong connection to   and were proud to send their children to apprenticeship under experienced Red Wizards. \n The Rashemi commoners identified less with their cultural origins and saw themselves as citizens of Thay, first and foremost. They shaved their heads in imitation of the aristocratic Mulani, though their darker complexion gave away their ethnic background. \n All Thayans believed that fortune was given to the strong-willed rather than those who demonstrated compassion and care.  As a people they sought personal power, primal fulfillment and the procurement of wealth. \n There were several prevalent music styles customary to the lands of Thay. Among them, powerful Red Wizards and zulkirs were outliers, preferring to listen to exotics pieces of music recorded elsewhere via specialty recording and playback spells. Such outsider music was played by magic and slave musicians, always privately during meditation, spell memorization, and relaxation. \n Thay's national music could be heard playing outside of the private chambers of the sorcerous ruling class. This common man's music was heavily influenced by slavery and heavily featured heavy drumbeats that set the music's tempo and rhythm, reminiscent of a march. This type of music was played on \"walking  \" \u2013 a unique percussive instrument found in Thay. These massive drums were half the average height of a human man and were shaped like a   toy. They were strapped to a drummer's chest and hammered with special paddles. A single drum orchestra could count to over a dozen musicians. This music was joined by   blasting martial-sounding fanfare. The trumpets joined in one at at a time, beginning with a single horn that began a wandering melodic line to the drum beat, then joined by a counter-melody from the second horn. These sonic duels alternated by brief harmonization of all the instruments, lastly ending in a fanfare-like resolution. This music was also played during military marches and during some long days of slave work.\n More private lower-class Thayan music could be heard in homes, clubs, and taverns. Faster melodies to dance to, often by attractive slave servers, staff, or other hired entertainment. These ditties were just as drum-centric, giving the beat to female vocalizations and singing. These drum-songs also came in slower, down-tempo varieties. Other instruments used in this type of music included  , piping  , and  . These songs, called \" ,\" or \" \"life-laments,\" had lyrics of repeated musical phrases that sounded like melancholic questions or challenges. Traditionally, thaeraeden sang about love troubles, commerce, and reputation in the eyes of the powerful Thayan wizards, referred to as \"greatspells.\"\n There was little innovation and experimentation in Thayan music, and it remained virtually unchanged for centuries. They rarely incorporated new melodies or new instruments. Thayvian public tended to care little for new songs and preferred to hear old favorite tunes.\n Thayans were considerably prejudiced towards non-human races, particularly   and  , who were regularly the subject of racial epithets and provocations to violence.   were also held in low regard, though typically avoided and shunned rather than provoked.   and   were well-tolerated within the badlands, as they were commonly found as enforcers and soldiers within Thayan legions.    were often kept as guards on Thayan slave plantations. \n By the late 14  century DR, Thay established trade relations with the worshipers of   who ran one of the districts of  , a walled island city in the  . Malphagor's followers purchased slaves in Thay to be transformed into undead servants and sold along the shores of the  . \n Beginning in the 10  century, Thay maintained a vast \"population\" of    , who were enthralled as laborers and porters, moving goods between ships docked in Thay's numerous waterways.  The number of undead grew exponentially during the decades under Szass Tam's rule, following the nation's   that ended in 1385 DR and, by  , Thay had the greatest concentration of undead in all of Faer\u00fbn. \n The hierarchy of worship in Thay was abundantly clear to everyone within its borders: magic was revered first, religion was a distant second. Despite the common misconception, The Red Wizards did not worship fiends nor did they consider the   or   as gods. They saw   as dangerous allies, servants or for the extremely arrogant, tools that could be manipulated to accomplish their goals. In fact, the Red Wizards simply did not have time that could be devoted to worship, and merely offered hollow words of worship to their patron deities, and only truly valued the power of the arcane. \n Although the Mulan people continued the worship of their   after they were transported to   by ancient   via a series of  ,  they did so in that lands of future-Thay with names that were different from their neighbors in   and  .  , the Mulhorandi god of war, was known as \"Ramathant\",  and came to count the Red Wizards as among his greatest enemies.  Similarly,   was known as \"Helcaliant\",  and   as \"Isharia\". \n Many of the  -aligned   of the   had devoted sects in Thay, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  , the demi-power   and even incorporated non-human powers such as  , the aspect of  ,   and even  . The   was extremely popular for a brief time following his ascension in the  , though it waned greatly as the god was driven mad after reading the  .  By this time the worship of   was fairly prevalent throughout the nation of Thay,  however it exploded in popularity following the events of the  . \n For centuries, Thay was ruled by a council of eight powerful   known as zulkirs, each of whom specialized in a different school of  . This Council of Zulkirs appointed the nation's   and tharchionesses, civil governors of the realm who ruled over the vast provinces of Thay, known as \"tharchs\".  Each tharchion chose their own \" \", who acted as mayors, military commanders and magistrates,  to enact their will over their lands and take blame as a scapegoat, should the need arise.  Their enclaves were led by \" \", who held approximately the same authority as the autharchs, albeit in strongholds located in foreign countries.  Above autharchs, stood the  , a singular title dedicated to settling policy disputes as well as conflicts between government officials. A cleric often held the position. Generally, the High Autharch was replaced every couple of decades due to burnout or by more violent means.  Each governing official was indebted to their superior, which created a sense of suspicion and fear among the nation's bureaucrats. Various rival factions and competing interests arose as a result of this dynamic, and the nation was not able to unite under a single vision for many years.  There was heavy turnover among the lesser bureaucrats, as each authority could assign blame in descending order of importance. While only the Red Wizards acted with real independence, their ranks were afflicted by similar scheming and in-fighting. \n This lack of unification continued for many years, until Szass Tam seized power as the regent and supreme ruler of Thay, during the chaos of the  . Thereafter, the zulkirs served as his vassals and the tharchions and lesser magistrates fell in line. \n The ownership, sale and creation of slaves was legal within the borders of Thay. \n While it was illegal for anyone from Thay to sell items of military value outside the nation, this law was often individually ignored,  and loosely enforced nation's famous enclaves found across the Realms.  \n In addition to operating under the laws of their home nation, the Red Wizard compounds were regulated by the  . These laws provided diplomatic immunity to the Red Wizards serving within an enclave and were required to be agreed upon by foreign city officials.  \n The nation was predominantly agrarian. The lush plantations of the Thayan plateau were rich with fields of  ,  , and   and its orchards produced a variety of fruits, such as apples, citron, pears and figs. Enough food was harvested that the nation could feed those citizens it deemed worthy, with enough goods leftover that could be exported in trade. \n Prior to the Spellplague, Thay exported a variety of goods to other nations, as they regularly had an excess of grain and other foodstuffs to feed their own people. Both   and   were dependent on Thayan exports to feed their people. Other exports included uniquely crafted furniture, sculptures, household items and jewelry crafted by slave craftspeople. These fine goods were often made from  ,   or  , all of which were readily available from Thay's plentiful mines, as well as   and  .  Another export of note was Thayan   that was not to be confused with Aglarondan  . \n Thay was famous throughout the Realms for the trade of  , an industry sponsored by the Red Wizards, who sold their crafted goods in the major cities of Faer\u00fbn.  In addition to acquiring wealth from the sale of arcane curios that were manufactured in Thay, these   were used to gather intelligence, another valuable commodity, for the Red Wizards and Council of Zulkirs. Among the   cities known to have enclaves were  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  , among others. \n Slavery was a common practice in Thay,  a tradition that continued on from the ancient empire of Mulhorand. Somewhat ironically, the slaves themselves were the nation's most important resource,  and were never to be needlessly destroyed.  Despite this, slaves were often treated terribly, even compared to other slave societies. Aside from the typical degradations, slaves in Thay were subject to magical experimentations, being fed to exotic monsters, or being sacrificed in dark rituals and ceremonies.  During the mid-14  century DR something between two-thirds and eight-tenths of Thay's living sentient population were slaves, making up half of the urban population and seven-eighths of the countryside.  Despite their great power, even the   considered uprisings and rebellions a constant threat to their personal safety. \n The zulkirs and other prominent Red Wizards grew rich beyond imagination by means of this sinister trade. From within their strongholds and estates, they used this wealth to constantly scheme and plot for mercantile and military domination of neighboring nations. \n The loose and arbitrary laws of Thay used enslavement as the default punishment for most crimes instead of imprisonment or banishment.  Many slaves were of   origin, but Thay's aggressive slave-trading practices meant that the majority were of other ethnicities. Agents from Thay traveled the world and legally bought criminals and life-sentenced slaves, while dedicated crews of brigands were hired to simply raid and kidnap whoever they could from the  .  Thay did not generally export slaves, and recently arrived slaves were never knowingly sold back if their friends and family made an offer. Instead, the rescuer was liable to be enslaved themselves. By the laws of Thay, any slave bought there was forever a slave, with no manumission possible. While escape and rescue was possible, any \"free\" slave would be treated as free property to be claimed, and the best that one could hope for was to please their master and be retired from labor. \n Slaves were utterly forbidden from shaving or cutting their hair, whether on their head or body. While even poor free folk kept their hair short and the upper classes shaved entirely, slaves were forced to keep whatever hair they grew\u2014and keep it clean and reasonably presentable, lest its state offend their betters.  While it could be tied and piled up atop their heads for convenience while working, in any other situations their hair had to be kept down to avoid any possible confusion. With permission they could have it trimmed to merely mid-back length, and if a medical treatment required shaving their master would have to weigh whether or not the slave was worth the trouble. If the slave was shaved and saved, they would have to be kept in seclusion until their hair grew back, lest they be seen in public and mistaken for a free person. \n Thay's predilection for aggressive and highly destructive wars with its neighbors demanded that its agriculture was handled by slaves while the free lower classes were used up in battle. While other lands relied on independent farmers and small landholders, Thay had no yeoman farmer middle class at all. Instead of scattered small villages, most Thayan agriculture was performed on huge centralized slave farms and plantations, owned by the nobility and often guarded by unpleasant  . These farms covered most of the arable land in Thay, with each region having a central town where everyone lived in between field work.  These included fields of several kinds of  , fruit orchards, and   pastures, and this produce found its way to many realms that would otherwise never deal with Thay.  Slaves from these farms were also deployed to perform repairs and maintenance on nearby roads, docks, and other pieces of infrastructure. \n Thay earned great wealth from a number of vast, slave-harvested timber plantations. Due to their readily-available work force, Thay was able to ship out great amounts of lumber cut from  ,   and regional    . \n Slaves were also tasked with mining, and being sent to the mines was considered among the worst possible fates for slaves. The   were no exception, and vast amounts of gold was brought up by the efforts of  's slaves. \n The nation of Thay possessed what was likely the strongest military in   ever seen by the 14  century DR. However they were rarely, if ever, led effectively in thanks to the competitive bickering that permeated the Thayan ruling class. Each zulkir and tharchion were empowered to raise their own legion, limited only to their own personal capital.  Many Red Wizards supplemented their forces with magical beasts, such as Zulkir   and the   he used to complement his legion of  . Red Wizards would always fight alongside their legions in every military engagement, if only to preserve order among the mixed and often-chaotic armies. \n During the 15  century, the armies of Thay were largely composed of ruthless undead, including  ,  ,  ,   and liches under the command of Regent Szass Tam's necromancers. The   were regiments of particularly cunning skeletal and zombified warriors who fought without fear of death or destruction.  They supplemented these undead legions with many monstrous creatures including  ,   and    . \n Infantry legions ranged in size anywhere from 800 to 2,000 soldiers and were composed of a wide range of forces, from  , human slaves,   ,  gnolls, and undead warriors.  The Thayan army was notorious for their use of monstrous   such as  ,   and  . In fact, one of Thay's finely-trained, deadliest regiments was  , a unit comprised entirely of   and  .  Thayan breeding experiments led to the creation of  , and both the black and red breeds were found within its borders in significant numbers. \n The   soldiers of Thay often wore armor of mirror-bright silver that gave off blinding reflections. Beneath the armor they wore white cloth slipcovers to prevent over-heating and betraying their location.  Slaves were typically given  -boots,  , headscarves,  , and\u2014if they were lucky\u2014a   hung with waterskins. \n The riders of Thay were an even more diverse group of nearly-unarmored lancers, mounted archers and heavy knights who rode a wide variety of mounts ranging from  giant cats,  ,  ,  ,   and very seldom,  .  The   of   was the most famous of Thay's aerial squadrons,  as was the infamous   cavalry, a regiment of all-female riders that were widely-feared throughout the Realms. \n The nation of Thay kept a small, but highly-efficient navy based out of a naval base located on the island-tharch of  . They were much more regimented than the infantry and cavalry, as they all fell under the authority of Alaor's tharchion. As of the 14  century, the navy was composed of several hundred magically-aided ships led by the great and terrifying metallic vessel called the  . \n The Thayvian navy swept the coasts of the   for hidden pirate villages, and enslaved whatever pirates they could catch, in addition to sometimes enslaving random fishing villages.  However, the navy did not use slaves as   rowers, instead using paid specialized crew. \n Thayan vessels were named using magic-related themes such as spells, schools of magic, or wizards, such as  ,  ,  , or  . \n The nation of Thay came about when a sect, calling itself the  , inspired by the archmage  , declared its freedom from the   of  .  The sect's center of strength was in the northern provinces where the natives did not have the inbred reverence for the god-kings. After razing the city of   they declared themselves the free nation of Thay in  , under the leadership of the    . Since then, Mulhorand has defended itself, quite successfully, against two invasions from Thay. \n The small upstart nation quickly prospered with their vast slave-driven economy. With a lust for greater power, a group of renegade Red Wizards attempted their first march on   in  , and faced a costly defeat in the   by the  .  Despite the temporary economic setback, Thay grew rapidly and ranks of the greedy, imperialistic Red Wizards swelled too large for them to effectively govern their own people. After years of bickering during the 10  century DR, the Red Wizards decided upon their system of rule and formed the Council of Zulkirs. One master of each of the eight   had a seat on the council, who in turn collectively appointed the tharchions who ruled over their given tharch. \n A few dissident Red Wizards disagreed with this system of rule and attempted to seize the nation for themselves during the 11  century. Their forces were put down by the Zulkirs in  . \n The armies of Thay marched on   and Rashemen many times and folk feared that the time would soon come when the zulkirs mobilized again. One such undertaking occurred in the year  , when the newly-appointed zulkir of  ,  , formed a tenuous alliance with the established zulkir of     and infamous   and zulkir of  , Szass Tam, in an attempted invasion of Aglarond. The assault was ultimately unsuccessful and the   repelled the Thayan forces in the   and Zulkir Thrul was blamed for the failure by Tam. The dark lich   the master illusionist, which left a power vacuum within the Council of Zulkirs. Chaos ensued as a number of lesser wizards competed for the high seat of office and Szass Tam withdrew his forces to his private estate, disgusted with the behavior of his colleagues. \n In  , the tharchion of     joined forces with the zulkirs of   and   in what was the then-most-ambitious plan of conquest ever undertaken in Thay. By means of powerful magic, the trio appealed to  , Lord of the  , and   of the   within the  , to aid Thay in a ruthless campaign against the independent coastal cities of the   and  . In return, the Red Wizards and tharchion promised then to maintain a permanent   on Toril, that connected the   to the  . However, this agreement was struck without the approval or favor of Kossuth, the   Lord of Flame. \n While the Thayans originally intended to simply   the elemental forces once the zulkirs seized the lands they desired, the Red Wizards were only able to send the efreeti back to their other-planar domain and the voracious salamanders ran rampant across  . Having brought their nation to the brink of annihilation, the outmatched triumvirate reached out to the rest of the Council of Zulkirs and began fighting back against the elemental reptiles with the combined forces Thay's standing army,   such as gnolls and  -kin, and the vast undead forces of Szass Tam which had been reluctantly withdrawn from an offensive in Rashemen. The Salamander War, as it came to be known, lasted for over a year until Aznar Thrul made a grand appeal to Kossuth. The Lord of Flame sent his own elementals to Faer\u00fbn and drove the salamanders horde out from Thay. Worship of Kossuth grew exponentially in Thay and its political landscape was permanently changed for decades to come. \n In 1375 DR, a rift had been growing within Council of Zulkirs and opposing factions were forming under the leadership of Aznar Thrul and the necromantic lich Szass Tam. In   of that year, Tam arranged a series of events that would divide the nation and place himself in a position to ascend as its savior.  First, he assassinated his strongest ally,  ,  which was blamed on his rival Thrul, and supplanted the   as zulkir with the easily-controllable  , aided by his confidant  .  Second, he orchestrated a Rashemi counter-attack on an unsanctioned invasion of Rashemen in the  ,  led by the tharchs   and  , proceeded to rescue their forces at precisely the right moment and rewrote the narrative in their favor,  Lastly he manufactured the menace of an undead horde that threatened all of eastern Thay. \n By   of that year, Tam had Aznar Thrul killed by an undead abomination,  in preparation for his appeal to the Council of Zulkirs. On  , Szass Tam appealed the council that he be named regent, for a temporary time, so that he may rid the nation of its threats and return Thay to prosperity. Unfortunately for the lich, Dmitra Flass had uncovered his scheme with the assistance of her spymaster,  , and approached the council about her misgivings beforehand. After entire council voted against Tam's proposal,  riots broke out in the capital of Eltabbar, clamoring for Szass Tam's ascension as Thay's supreme ruler.  While the zulkir of necromancy soothed the anger of the Thayan people,  he withdrew from the council, marshaled his undead army and attempted to take Thay by force. \n The first battle occurred on on  , when the combined armies of the Council of Zulkirs assaulted the  , Szass Tam's fortress that had been supplied with undead from a manufactory hidden within the  .  The council managed to win the battle,  destroying the     who commanded Tam's forces at the keep,  and their   slowed the movement of the lich's remaining undead army in the following tenday.  \n Szass tam appeared before a small conclave of Thayan officers on   and ensured them their actions would result in a long, drawn-out war that would engulf their entire nation.  In fact the two warring factions would battle throughout the next decade,  and Tam's forces slaughtered Thayan peasants, poisoned their lands and caused massive floods and other natural disasters. Along with the horrors of war, famine ravaged the previously abundant lands of Thay. \n By   the warring factions of Thay arrived at a stalemate. Szass Tam held the northern tharchs of  ,  ,  ,   and Thaymount, while the other zulkirs maintained a hold over  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and the islands of  .  In  ,  , the tharchion of Lapendrar warned the council that Szass Tam was planning an assault on the  . \n On  , the legions of northern Thay marched upon the Keep of Sorrows. While the council attempted to pincer Tam's forces against the keep's walls,  the     created an artificial darkness over the battlefield, summoned undead horrors and turned the time of the battle in Tam's favor. Just before the lich could claim victory,  the goddess of magic,   was killed, and the blue flames of the   ravaged Thay and all of Toril.    magic ceased to function properly and pure chaos broke out on the battlefield. Tam's legions took the keep and the council forces withdrew to the isolated town of  . \n As a result of the Spellplague, the Thayan plateau rose thousands of feet in height and altered its place on the face of Toril. Rivers took new courses across the lands and the volcanoes of Thaymount erupted in violent explosions. These geological events began to reshape the previously-controlled Thayan landscape. Some cities were destroyed while others were unrecognizable. The icy glaciers of High Thay began to melt, which sent boulders and debris tumbling down the   down to the greater plateau. Volcanic ash filled the sky and the magically-protected climate of Thay was no more. \n After a few more skirmishes fought in confusion, Szass Tam made a pact with the dark god  . In exchange for insight into the changed function and form of arcane magic, along with powers to rule over Thay for the next 1000 years, he offered forth his soul, and promised that divine worship in his kingdom would be solely dedicated to the  . \n Tam's greatest victory came at   on  . The lich's legions rebuked the attack of the council's legions, aided by the   summoned forth by the powers lent by the god Bane.  The council fled south and briefly regrouped in Bezantur,  before sailing off for Escalant in the   to the west.  Szass Tam was greeted in Bezantur to cheers and adulation. He summoned a magical storm to slow the fleet of the Red Wizards, and sent his own forces after them.  As the council ships gained the upper hand in the sea battle, Szass Tam withdrew his forces and allowed the Council of Zulkirs to leave Thay. \n On the eve of his coronation as High Regent, Szass Tam gained great magical insight in the form of an ancient   that described the  .  He begun construction on several  , great fortresses that served as markers for the arcane power that coursed through all of Thay that, upon completion of the ritual, could potentially erase all of existence as it was known throughout the Realms. \n While the lands, waters and skies of Thay had been ravaged by war and magic during the end of the 14  century, the following decades saw a great transformation among the nation's people. The living people of Thay were increasingly disregarded as the Red Wizards fully embraced a new existence as  , liches and other servitors of undeath. Seats within the reformed Zulkir Council were filled by the most powerful of these undead arcanists. \n On    , Bareris Anskuld uncovered a book from the former house of Druxus Rhym that illuminated the grand scheme that Szass Tam had been working on over the past 90 years.

But in its natural state, snow was a common sight on the Thayan lands of high elevation, such as the Thaymount and the Sunset Mountains, while in the High Thay plateau, snow was rare. It received occasional hoar frosts and sleet storms. As a whole, Thay's temperature extremes between daylight and night caused regular ground fogs that were more common than other forms of precipitation. When snow or rain did happen, they were brief, sometimes powerful downpours that moved across Thay speedily, with the moving storm front seen from afar. \n Under Red Wizards' control, Thay received steady nighttime rains to boost the nation's agriculture and hinder roaming monstrous marauders, bandits, and rebels. \n Notably, several species of   creatures had been hunted to the brink of extinction in Thay due to the spell-fortifying properties of  . \n Few invasions ever overcame the great mountains girding the  , and the secretive and suspicious Red Wizards raised barriers just as formidable to discourage travelers from venturing into their lands.

One of the most abundant and well known plants in Thay were   that turned red when ripened, very poisonous fruit.  \n During the Spellplague however, the plateau of Thay rose thousands of feet above Toril, melting its glaciers and causing great volcanic eruptions within Thaymount. Over the following century, it became a dark and foreboding land of lifeless badlands, windswept mountains and barren deserts.  By the 15  century, the skies over Thay were plagued with ash and smoke that spewed skyward from the volcanic peaks of Thaymount. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thay"},

That being said, anyone who obeyed the laws could walk freely through the city's streets. \n Anyone caught in the act of breaking the law was immediately apprehended and punished, either by the Watch or the Flaming Fist. Typically, the punishment fit the crime. Lesser crimes, such as violence or thievery, warranted a public whipping or removal of a finger. Those who broke agreed-upon contracts were sentenced to forced labor while disturbing the peace or public lasciviousness led to public shaming by night in the stocks. \n The city of Baldur's Gate issued hostelry licenses to proprietors of inns and taverns within the city walls. Lodging business could not legally operate without said license. \n Throughout its history, various thieves guilds had risen and fallen in Baldur's Gate, including the one led by  ,    and the  . Since the fall of these groups in the late 14  century,   , led by   emerged as the predominant thieves' organization in Baldur's Gate.  Nearly all of the smaller gangs of the Outer and Lower City regions owed at least some obedience to this influential organization. \n Throughout its history, Baldur's Gate had little stake in the affairs of others. For the most part, the city was respected as a neutral power, that never involved itself with the politics and conflicts that arose between the other states of the Sword Coast and the Western Heartlands. Perhaps more importantly, Baldur's Gate, while undoubtedly a rich prize, was so well-defended by its massive walls and well-trained Flaming Fists soldiers that few ever seriously considered invading and occupying the city. \n Historically, Baldur's Gate has had a long enmity with its southern neighbor,  , which nearly resulted in war during the iron crisis of the 1360s.  Over the next century however, the only major threats to Baldur's Gate were the pirates operating out of the ruins of   or the merchants of Waterdeep, who resented the city's continually-growing wealth and power. \n The   of Baldur's Gate was one of the largest, busiest and most popular ports-of-call found on the western coast of Faer\u00fbn, handling a wide variety of cargoes that rivaled even the sprawling ports of  .  Due to the fact trade was not tied to any individual's  , anyone conducting business in a non-harmful manner was welcome to trade in the city.  By virtue of this tolerant outlook, Baldur's Gate had become the greatest center of trade along the entire Sword Coast in the 15  century, out-competing both Waterdeep and Amn.  \n For years, Baldur's Gate minted its own    , the most common variety of which was a 1 lb (0.5 kg) bar worth 5  . More importantly, the city also set the value for this form of currency and regulated its use in trade. \n Baldur's Gate sponsored nearly 90 professional guilds, from seafarers and financiers from the Upper City, to loremasters, brewmasters, metalworkers and nearly every skilled tradesperson in between.  While the honest and once-powerful mercantile guild known as the  ,  previously dominated trade in the city, it was banned by the Council of Four and forced to operate in secret. Similarly, the secretive collective of noble-merchants known as the   operated in an unofficial capacity.  While the  's influence grew and diminished throughout the 14  and 15  centuries, they continued to control trade of the weapons and armor that were used by the Watch and the Fist. \n The cloth market was a trades event that was held annually in late summer, or early fall. The market attracted the best textile weavers, seamsters, and gown makers, including   of  . \n As of the mid-1300s DR, stone was usually imported from   via   for use in construction, having been magically transported from up north. This feat of arcane conveyance was quite expensive. \n Historically speaking, Baldur's Gate was naturally well-defended by its location in a natural inlet,  and the great wall that was financed by Balduran,  who was widely believed to the the city's founder.  However, its security was often attributed to its political neutrality and the worldview of its leadership. While the city remained dedicated to the termination of threats that jeopardized trade and commerce in the Sword Coast, it refused to involve itself with the region's political conflicts. \n Defense of the   fell under the responsibility of  , the constables who enforced the laws of the city's   noble class. As it has been for over a century before the  , the rest of the city was policed by members of the  . Many officers within the Fist were \"retired\" adventurers and its highest rank of Marshal, was by tradition, one of the Grand Dukes. \n While the Fist always kept a strong contingent within the city's walls, they doubled as the city's standing army and were free to hire themselves out in external conflicts as long as they were never aligned against the city.  At the behest of their leaders, they even embarked upon journeys to the then-newly-discovered continent of  .  After a century of serving as defenders of the city, they had become so entwined with the fate of its well-being, they operated as the   police force for domestic concerns and its bulwark for threats from abroad. \n In addition to the 1,700-plus soldiers of the Flaming Fist, the Grand Dukes commanded a navy of a half dozen ships with crews of at least 40 men each. \n Long before the land was settled, the lee of the plateau where Baldur's Gate would one day stand was known as  . It was ruled by a   named  . Only after his death, sometime before the  , the first fisher settlement sprung into existence \u2013 the village of Loklee.  It was believed that at some point prior to the  , the then mortal Bhaal performed his first murder in a back-alley of this very region of Faer\u00fbn, the blood from which eventually formed into the dagger  . \n With time, the harbor-settlement that came to be known as Baldur's Gate became a well-hidden meeting place for pirates, scavengers and \"ghost lighters\". These naer-do-wells used lights to trick ships sailing through the foggy coast, running them aground before pilfering their goods. After looting what they could, they sailed up the River Chionthar to the small bay, to their secluded haven called  .  By the  , Gray Harbor and the village of Loklee that supported it were well known as a port of call for ships from across the Sword Coast. The settlement had a shipyard and visitors' wharves. \n In olden times, the seafaring hero   returned home to Gray Harbor, from a voyage to the far-off continent of  , far beyond the   isle of  . He had accumulated great wealth on this journey. After hiding some of his riches away in hidden caches, he ordered a great granite wall to be built for the protection of his home. Soon after, Balduran set sail on a second voyage to the continent and subsequently vanished, never to return. \n After Balduran vanished, sometime in the mid-1000s DR,  local farmers took control of the wall's construction and used it to protect their own holds and farmsteads, rather than the harbor.  Nearby townsfolk and other outsiders flocked to the fledgling town for protection, and the hamlet swelled in size. The walled region of Gray Harbor came to be known as \"Old Town\", while newly-constructed buildings, between the southern wall and the harbor, were built in the portion thereafter known as \"Heapside\".  And by the  , the settlement was a city widely known as Baldur's Gate. Some scholars said that the name \"Baldur's Gate\" was already in existence sometime before the  ,  named after the   smith  , who saw the settlement grow around his workshop. The dwarf was given the nickname \"Baldur,\" which he used to do business under, and, with time, most believed that the nickname was his actual name. \n The division of the town by its great wall created a schism between the landowners of Old Town and Balduran's former associates, the captains and other seafarers of Gray Harbor. The Old Towners taxed the carts coming north from the harbor, through  , which led to the ire of the seamen and their eventual refusal to pay. \n As their anger turned to action, the smugglers, pirates, and merchants of Heapside breached Baldur's Gate and stormed Old Town by force. Just before they laid siege to the keep of High Hall, the four most-senior sea captains argued for the farmer-lords' surrender. After a quick vote, a truce was struck between the two parties, and the retired captains were installed as leaders, jokingly known as \"Dukes\", of the rapidly-growing city that was earnestly renamed Baldur's Gate. \n Following the founding of the nation of Amn, trade skyrocketed in Baldur's Gate, and the city expanded. This propensity secured the renewed connection between Old Town, which came to be known as the Upper City, and Heapside, now called the Lower City. The fate of all Baldurian citizens was entwined as one, a significance that was reflected in the expanded construction of the city wall. The bluffs of the Lower City were protected by two extensions of the Old Wall that continued south to the northern shores of the River Chionthar. \n The city became the most powerful force in the Western Heartlands and, despite its neutrality, joined the Lords' Alliance. The city was only recorded to have been called upon by the Alliance once, in the  , when the   of   attempted to invade. They sent their top military general,  , to drive them off. While she achieved victory at first, she eventually betrayed Baldur's Gate and was killed in the   by Baldurian forces. \n The   was marked by the   that raged across Baldur's Gate. One of the notable events that took place during the riots was  , when Druke   personally entered the fray in an attempt to redeem his image by quelling the riots. Duke was adorned in his     made in the image of Balduran, wielded a new, freshly forged  , and led a squad of Flamings Fists atop a massive and expensive gray destrier. Suldrian's Charge was an initial success as the third of the rioters fled in mere sight of the shiny, armored Duke. The tide quickly turned when someone launched a \"missile\" from the crowd at the armored Duke; the missile's nature was debated and also became a common tavern joke and a topic of many raunchy songs. This soiled \"missile\" activated the magic armor's sole enchantment. To the wearer's protestations, the   began polishing itself with the closest banner it could grab. Fighting against the armor's movements, Suldrian fell off his horse. His erratic behavior scared the Flaming Fists away, thinking the leader was affected by some foul magic. Duke Suldrian was left alone with a rioting mob, and rioting mobs were not known for their mercy. When the Bread Riots ended, Duke Suldrian's body was found, still encased in a spotless and shiny armor that was untouched by the mob. Historians speculated that the mob was scared off by the fact that, in their eyes, the Duke refused to die even after countless deadly wounds, continuing to move and shine his plates. \n The   began operating in Baldur's Gate in the early 14  century  . In the  , the     orchestrated   to send the city to war with  . The plan failed and within two years all Bhaalspawn were killed due to the actions of the future Grand Duke,  . \n Later that year, the city was nearly overwhelmed by the scores of refugees that were displaced from their homes by the   surrounding the   and her  . The Flaming Fist joined with nearby armies to form a   that met the rising threat at  . \n A group known   moved into Baldur's Gate early in the  . Three adventurers,  ,  , and   arrived and thwarted the guild's plans in the city. Joined by the  , they discovered the thieves guild to be only part of a larger plot involving   and her dark alliance.  Eldrith's disciple, a   known as   sought to destroy the city in the years that followed. In the end however, Mordoc too was defeated and the city saved in the  . \n In the  , Faer\u00fbn suffered the  , a cataclysmic event that reshaped both civilizations and the land itself. Fortunately, Baldur's Gate was unharmed from the effects of the blue fire that rained from the sky. As it was known throughout Faer\u00fbn as an \"open city\", the Gate became a haven for a great number of refugees that fled the destruction that wracked the lands around the  . Within a matter of years, the population of the city tripled. Mercifully, the city was able to support itself following these years of intense growth and expansion. \n During the mid-1400s, the Grand Duke  , General   and the   attempted to usurp the leadership of Baldur's Gate. The failure of his attack led to the reformation of the Baldurian government, with the newly-formed Parliament of Peers offerring assistance to, and electing the members of, the Council of Four.  Abdel Adrian replaced Valarken as both Grand Duke and Marshal of the Flaming Fist. \n By the  , Baldur's Gate was Faer\u00fbn's most powerful and important city, and it was once again stable. At this time, it was no longer bothered by Valarken and Amn. It maintained a positive relationship with the nation of   and the other powers of the Western Heartlands.  However, the expansion proved to turn the city on its heels, threatening to send it into civil war. \n While making a public speech on Returning Day, in the  , Grand Duke Abdel Adrian was attacked by a man named  , the only other remaining Bhaalspawn. Although it was unknown who emerged as the victor, it was known that both men died\u2014one at the hands of his mortal sibling, the other after having transformed into the  , an avatar of the long-dead Bhaal.  \n The remaining Council of Four blamed the Grand Duke's death on agents of  , the city's most prevalent thieves' group, and enlisted a group of adventurers help investigate the tragedy.  Shortly after, the city experienced a sudden spike of criminal activity including robberies  and vandalism, which caused the Flaming Fist to crack down on some shadier establishments in the Lower City and Outer City regions.  As the Baldurian Parliament responded by passing bewildering sumptuary laws, stating that citizens had to wear attire befitting their station,  vandals removed the hands of five beloved statues that decorated the city. \n Despite the best efforts by the adventurers, the Watch and the Flaming Fist, whose leadership was assumed by  , the city erupted into chaos. As city workers went on strike and the Upper City was placed on a lockdown-curfew at mid-afternoon,  the merchant-class of the Lower City became incensed and unruly.  As Outer City residents protested against the city officials, petty vandalism escalated to arson and even kidnappings.  In response, the free press of the city, known as   was shut down and the new leader of the Fist instituted a series of illegal tribunals. \n After a group of Outer City residents clashed with a contingent of Flaming Fist soldiers in the district of  ,  riots erupted throughout the Lower and Outer City regions.  After an explosion erupted in  , the city was placed under martial law.  The adventurers hired by the Council discovered the chaos in the city was a result of the  Grand Duke Torlin Silvershield's plot to destroy the corrupted Baldurian Parliament, in a dramatic immolation of stockpiled  , and sever the Guild's subversive influence over Baldurian officials.  He revealed himself as the   of the re-ascended god of murder, Bhaal,  before he was slain by the adventurers of Baldur's Gate. \n In the  , Baldur's Gate was caught up in the plot of an     named   and  . The cult marched on the city, while the brain, now a \"netherbrain\" due to its empowerment by the  , burst from a cave system underneath the city, destroying large portions of multiple districts, though the upper city was affected most. The siege by the Cult of the Absolute ended when a group of heroes climbed the brain and either destroyed or dominated it. \n Since the days of Balduran himself, tales of the wealth he brought back from across the Sea of Swords were prevalent throughout the city. For centuries, rumors persisted that there was a hidden cache of riches hidden somewhere deep beneath the city, within the caves of the   cliffside. \n Map of Baldur's Gate in the late 15  century DR. Hovering over the map will reveal main locations and features. Clicking will link to the article for that location. Baldur's Gate was divided into three main sections, as shown in the map to the right. The   was the walled region to the north. The   was the portion between the Old Wall and the  .  The   was the shantytown that rose up along the roads to the city and around  . \n The Upper City of Baldur's Gate radiated wealth and beauty, serving as home to the city's   class. It had wide, well-lit streets and attractive buildings decorated with hanging plants. The amenity of the Upper City was only matched by its well-kept safety, largely thanks to the regular patrols maintained by the Watch. \n The region consisted of four districts:  ,  , the   and  . \n The Lower City was the large, crescent-shaped portion of Baldur's Gate fully contained within the walls. It featured tightly-packed streets, lined with tall and slender buildings. even narrower alleyways that were always busy with the comings and goings of city life. Trade, commerce and work of all sorts dominated the sprawling Lower City. \n It had six districts:  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . \n Beneath the streets of the city was a sprawling, underground festhall known as the  . Dank cellars, twisting corridors and cramped tunnels composed its extensive network that stretched beneath nearly every corner of the Upper City region. Entrances into this secretive domain were numerous, but well-controlled, either by private, mercantile or criminal enterprises. \n Even deeper underground, beyond the Undercellar, was a series of subterranean tunnels and caves. Within one of the vast caverns were the ruins of an old settlement that came to be known as the  . By the 14  century only one structure remained amongst the decrepit foundations and  -infested streets. This was an old   that was once reclaimed by the Bhaalspawn Sarevok. \n These tunnels extended further down, under the surface of Toril, going so far as to connect to the  . One of these natural formations opened up into the  , an expanse that housed the tower of a   that went missing during the mid-15  century. \n The Outer City of Baldur's Gate was a sprawling, chaotic shantytown that grew outside of the city's walls. Day and night blended together throughout the lean-to's, stockyards and other shacks and lined the Outer City's muddy streets. While the animal-handlers, merchant-hawkers and other \"outsiders\" were taxed and technically \"ruled\" over by the Grand Dukes, city officials did little to truly govern the unregulated Outer City. \n It had nine districts, most of which encircled  :  , located north from the  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , which extended south from the  , and  , south of  . \n Wyrm's Crossing was the great double-bridge that spanned the River Chionthar, which extended north and south from the island-fortress of  . A myriad of different buildings were constructed on top of the crossing: from elaborate, several-story mercantile shops to small vendor stalls and even precariously-built businesses that hung off the side of the stone bridge, overlooking the waters of the Chionthar. \n The bridge stood atop massive arches that allowed ample room for sea traffic to pass unhindered. It was wide enough to allow overland travelers to pass through its many buildings, along the road that led into Baldur's Gate proper. \n The population of Baldur's Gate was always dominated by  , though other races such as  ,  , and to a lesser extent some  , settled within the city and were not looked upon differently.  The older districts of the Upper City and Lower City were quite diverse, while newer neighborhoods and those of the Outer City saw some homogenization along ethnic and racial lines. While no race was outright banned, more-monstrous   such as  ,   and   were a rare sight indeed. \n As anyone was welcome to visit or conduct business in The Gate, its population continually swelled as the city's geographical size grew well beyond its walls. How the city did not collapse upon itself, was unfathomable to many. \n Adventurers were a welcome presence in the Gate, many of whom came from the far corners of   to seek opportunities for fame, fortune or whatever alluring endeavour presented itself. Even those from unlikely walks of life found themselves enticed by the stories that filled the city's taverns and inns, giving in to the temptation of thrill and excitement. \n Many lower and working-class individuals lived in the streets of the Lower and Outer City regions. While low-skilled laborers and dock-workers ensured goods arrived to their destinations in the Gray Harbor, tradesfolk such as tanners, smiths, garment-makers and the like produced their goods throughout the city. The industry of these laborious individuals drove the economy of the greatest mercantile power of the Sword Coast. \n The merchants of Baldur's Gate were famous across the Realms for their heroic work ethic, keen sense of business and outright gumption. \n The wealthy patriar families were the nobility of the Upper City. While their lives were viewed as the epitome of luxury and opulence, many were civic-minded benefactors that genuinely strived to improve their home city.  This Baldurian elite-class was limited to a few select   families, along with the    ; no matter how rich any businessmen or merchants became, they could not buy their way into the Baldurian patriar. \n While cats were abundantly found throughout the city, as they were used to eliminate vermin from cargo ships, dogs were not a common sight by any stretch. Livestock, such as horses, cows, goats and like, were prohibited from the city proper,  relegated to the paddocks and pens of the Outer City.  The city's law forbade animals bigger than a   to gain entrance into the city. Some considered that regulation to be archaic. \n A 15  century   map of Baldur's Gate.

During the height of Shadovar rule, around  , the temperatures were moderated and it rained in the region,  after the fall it returned to desert.  Anauroch was commonly divided into three general regions: the northern  , the middle  , and   in the south.  \n The High Ice was a frozen land of rocks and glacier.

Some decades later in 1372 DR, the   returned from the   with the goal of restoring the land of Netheril, and stationed their flying city called   near the Scimitar Spires. \n The Bedine were a nomadic human people who lived in the wastes and traveled from oasis to oasis, rarely lingering staying anywhere for long. They made a living by guiding caravans through the hidden passes and by raiding. They comprised dozens of small tribes, each led by a sheik. Their wealth was counted not by  , but by the size and health of their herds.  They were suspicious of magic at the best of times. \n The Zhentarim, always eager to make a profit, fought long and hard to secure routes for their caravans through the desert. They found the northern routes over the High Ice threatened by more monsters than they could fight, while in the south humanoid raiders and interference from the   and   hindered their efforts. Thus, the Zhentarim went across the sandy southern land of the Sword, working for years to establish a caravan route via caravanserais at various oases. The Zhentarim garrisons and their own raiders fought constantly against the Bedine to keep hold of their claimed territory, but despite years of bitter fighting, the Zhentarim held little more land in Anauroch than that on which they stood. \n Initially upon their return, the Shadovar ignored the human inhabitants of Anauroch,  focusing instead on tempering the climate and exterminating the phaerimm. They went about altering the climate by magically creating the   where the   was  and melted the High Ice.  By  , rain fell, the temperature was moderated, and the Anauroch was an arid dust bowl spotted with youthful forests, rivers, and grasslands.  The Shadovar declared the phaerimm extinct on Toril. \n During the interim, the Shadovar fought the   with the Zhentarim, and the Zhents lost control of the Black Road.  The Shadovar also exterminated, subjugated or drove out a number of other races. \n Their relationship with the Bedine was complex. Many former Bedine considered themselves citizens of Netheril by 1479 DR, and were residents of the rebuilt cities of  , Orofin, Rasilith, and Oreme  or worked as servants in Shade. The Shade allowed other Bedine to live as herders with minimal harassment, but forbade them from practicing magic.  \n Other Bedine fought adamantly against them, allying with foreign powers and Zhentarim to resist Shadovar rule.  A full rebellion began two years before Shade crashed into Myth Drannor. \n After the fall, Shadovar survivors clashed with Bedine around the Memory Spire, awakening a hive of dormant phaerimm. \n Below the dunes of Anauroch lurked what remained of the evil  , a race of spellcasters with near-unrivaled mastery of the  , long imprisoned in a magical shell called the   under the desert.

Eventually, their empire fell at the hands of the phaerimm and they were forced by the Netherese to scatter. \n In the  , the phaerimm started casting spells in the land of Netheril. These would eventually cause the creation of Anauroch. \n After the fall of Netheril in the  , survivors from the three enclaves that were saved by   formed the   in the southeast, but the sands and conflicts overtook them within a few centuries.  \n The Netheril region was renamed Anauroch in the  . \n In the  , the Anauroch desert finally stopped expanding outward as the   had defeated the phaerimms.

Shortly after her birth, her mother took her to an   village near   and abandoned her to their care.  Cybriana was a typical   baby, marred only by a strange dark birthmark that, as she grew older, developed into a horrid growth bearing an evil face, seeming to contain a dark spirit. When Cybriana was a little girl, the growth caused a sickness that threatened to kill her. To save the girl's life, the elves performed a shamanic rite to extract the growth and trap the dark spirit within a crystal sphere. Cybriana was cured and freed, but the spirit escaped.  The dark spirit flew over the countryside, absorbing life energy and taking the form of a   elf woman named  . \n Meanwhile, the monstrous being  , trapped within the enchanted gem known as  , observed this and forged a magical link with Kilili, allowing him to escape into the Realms. However, he needed Cybriana and Kilili together to release the rest of his people. Kilili fell in with Imgig, and together they hatched their scheme.  Somehow, Cybriana, now grown to adulthood, learned that this \"sister\" had gone missing or been kidnapped. She learned that they were but fragments of one being and, unless they were reunited, her life and many other lives could be lost.  She feared what her dark half might do if left unchecked. \n Kyriani descends and gives   to Priam.

In their journeys to cure Priam, she told the companions her story. When she mentioned  , Priam realized they shared a father. But, just then, the group heard Imgig's chasme pursuing new victims and raced to the rescue. \n Imgig Zu observed   glow like the moon, meaning that Kilili's sister was near his tower and had been found. Kilili visited Cybriana lured her close to Imgig's tower. Imgig's   snatched up Cybriana and she was taken into their lair.  In the caverns beneath Imgig's tower, the proximity of Cybriana and Kilili, both to each other and to  , caused the gem to glow even more brightly and to swell in size. Imgig Zu used their combined powers to open the   and release his long-imprisoned people to overrun and conquer the Realms. Cybriana's companions fought their way in, but too late, as Imgig's people escaped, and the heroes were subdued. An exultant Imgig taunted Priam and threatened to kill him as he had killed Ostus Agrivar. But the roof of the cavern tore open and the brilliant light of the full moon shone through, blinding the ogres. Cybriana urged her brother Priam to strike, and he slew Imgig Zu in the name of their father. \n Cybriana escaped and grabbed Kilili, and when they touched, they merged into one being, part good and part evil, and the living key to  . The Cybriana-half gained dominance over the Kilili-half, and the merged being vanished inside the gem, drawing all of Imgig's people back within, saving the Realms from devastation at the cost of her unique identity. A merged being levitated down, bearing the shrunken  , and wearing the shredded remains of Cybriana's dress and the earrings of both women. Part Cybriana and part Kilili, she combined their names and named herself \"Kyriani\". Kyriani and her companions returned to the Sel\u00fbne's Smile where Luna rewarded them.

Hanifar lured her and Onyx to the site with a false   from Priam and, after they fought over a misunderstanding of his intent, explained that he needed one of the blood of Agrivar to control and close it.

Regardless, the Door protected itself with a bolt of magic that separated Kyriani back into Cybriana and Kilili.  Parwyyd divined that this was possible because Kyriani had never fully accepted her evil half, and therefore was not whole. Once Cybriana accepted that she, like her father, had both good and evil inside, she was able to merge with Kilili for the second and final time, and a new Kyriani was born. She combined her powers with Parwyyd's to close the Door, and the   behind it was slain. Kyriani thanked Parwyyd for giving her the truth of her nature and the courage to accept it. Kyriani felt that she was not the same Kyriani as before, but in fact the Kyriani she was meant to have been all along, accepting both sides of her nature and able to forge her own destiny.

Dodging flaming arrows, he returned her to the Smile, where the heroes vowed to rescue Luna from the House of the Moon. \n A dozen days after Luna's capture, while Onyx and Timoth searched the temple, Kyriani and Vajra met with another of her lovers,  , a former priest of the dark goddess  , for some insight; he warned Shar was present in the city. Kyriani and Vajra went to the House of the Moon and rescued Timoth and Onyx from the  ; Kyriani's   produced   instead.

Kyriani valiantly held Shar off while Timoth, Vajra, and Onyx struggled to open the dimensional doorway to Luna's inner room, where her godly power was stored, and released Sel\u00fbne's godly power to Luna. She transformed into the true avatar of Sel\u00fbne and with her   blasted away Shar's darkness. Shar vanished, and Sel\u00fbne became Luna once more. The companions reunited, Luna vowed to rebuild her inn. \n After the Smile's brief destruction, Kyriani aided   in driving   out of the city.

Afterward, Khelben took the lead lawyer to meet Onyx and his alleged wife on their court-appointed wedding night, claiming Onyx had to fulfill a dwarf marriage custom, the \"Bedchamber Trek\", or else the marriage would be invalid. The lawyer had to escort Onyx to the bed to enforce the ruling. However, Khelben created a nightmarish   for this trek and the terrified lawyer fled in horror, abandoning Onyx and thus reneging on the lawyers' contract with the city, rendering it void as Khelben had planned.

Upon her arrival, she was named as the third Blackstaff with   at her side atop Blackstaff Tower.  The same year, she wrote a book titled  . \n After Kyriani's death, her spirit remained in Blackstaff Tower to guide and advise future Blackstaffs. This was due to her wearing the  . \n The first Kyriani was a wholly good person, denying the natural dark side of her being.  Kyriani didn't like to see her friends get hurt, nor would she leave them to face danger, even if there was a greater need. \n However, the second Kyriani was more accepting of her dark side, and felt able to choose her destiny.  She said her two previously warring halves had at last been properly merged into one complete person. \n Around  , Kyriani appeared to be a tall and slender   woman, quite beautiful, with pointed ears and pale skin,  despite her   heritage.  Other details of her appearance varied with her incarnation. The first incarnation of Kyriani had a large mane of long, curly, light-brown hair, with violet  or blue eyes.

During this period, the militia numbered around 6,000. \n Aglarond also has a strong tradition of local militias. When the size of the army was insufficient to deal with a threat, everyday people in Aglarond took up arms, using   and pikes. The 6,000 trained troops could easily be joined by four times that number of citizens. \n Aglarond did not formally have a navy. The Foresters used boats called   for transportation and raids, especially against invading forces. \n In the late 1400s DR, the military of Aglarond was used to cement the control of the Simbarch Council, first through the suppression of resistance to the new government in outlying regions of the country and later as a defense against the encroaching threat of Thay.

Those half-elves living deeper in the Yuirwood were in touch with their   ancestry, preferring to live the elven way, in small communities, or as hunter-gatherers.

The blind god ruled over law and justice, encouraging valiant acts from his followers and relentlessly pursuing  .  Followers of Tyr were expected to show fairness, wisdom, and kindness to the innocent.  Tyrrans never enforced an unjust law. \n After the Time of Troubles, an entire decade passed where Tyr forbid specialty priests within his church. The clergy believed that he wished to ensure that no members of the faith were treated with greater favor than others. After other churches mocked them for this, Tyr established special orders of priests beginning after the   in  . \n As the only lawful member of the Norse pantheon, Tyr faded largely from prominence. For this reason, he sought a means of strengthening his power by obtaining worshipers from other worlds. He chose the crystal sphere of   and submitted himself to the authority of the overgod Ao. \n The first recorded instance of Tyr on Toril was in the  ,    . A warrior known as   and a group of priests were said to have met with Tyr in person in the mountains near the northern border of  . In response, Belaros crafted the mighty  , the  . \n For at least 5,000 years of Faer\u00fbnian history, Tyr also seemed to appear under other names\u2014 ,  ,  , and Anachtyr, among others. Under one of these names, he was a member of   before that empire's fall. \n In Calimshan, Anachtyr had been worshiped for far longer than Tyr had been in other parts of Faer\u00fbn.  For example, Anachtyr's followers were known to have slain the     in the   in  .  Among the Calishites, religious legends suggested that the god who was Tyr passed on his portfolio to another at the end of each millennium, and that Anachtyr was actually an earlier Tyr who passed his portfolio on to the Norse newcomer. \n Tyr, in his most recent form, first made a major historical impact on the world of Toril in a campaign to pacify the remnants of the fallen empire of Jhaamdath in the  . This was known as the  , in which the god himself appeared on Toril by   near future   in Turmish to lead a host of ten scores of   against the chaotic and evil forces arrayed in the  , in the remains of the fallen empire. \n Ilmater aligned himself with Tyr in  , being impressed by the sacrifices made by Tyr, and the conflict continued until  .  At the end of the great Procession, most of Tyr's archon warriors had been slain or banished,  but he was successful in destroying  , a god of anarchy,  and by this time, Tyr was committed to inspiring justice on Toril as a whole. Torm joined them to complete the Triad some years later. \n However, the faith of Tyr did not become a dominant one in Faer\u00fbn until shortly before the establishment of the  ,  when most of the other members of the pantheon were already well-established in their roles,  but after some 1,600 years since the Procession of Justice, Tyr successfully had become known over all of Faer\u00fbn. \n Tyr lost his right hand to  ,  in a test of his honor and strength of will.  The   had previously banned all mortals and powers from any contact with Kezef, but he was still free to consume souls, and a coalition of gods joined together to stop the Chaos Hound once and for all. This alliance included Tyr.  They pursued the   beast to the  ,  where they offered him a deal.  They would lift the ban on him if he could escape from chains forged for him by  . Kezef insisted that if this were truly a fair challenge then Tyr must be willing to place his right hand into the elder evil's mouth. Tyr agreed.  Kezef was enchained, the chain was anchored deep in   in  ,  and   placed an enchantment to prevent the chain from ever being severed.  Furious, Kezef bit off Tyr's hand. It was said that he feasted on the god's hand, drawing power from it, for centuries.  (Among the  , the story of the loss of Tyr's hand was similar but involved the members of the Aesir and the entity Fenris Wolf instead. )\n At some point, the conman   made a deal with Tyr: he promised to bring the god the  , (which was then in the possession of the tyrannical crime-lord    ,) in exchange for some unknown service, debt, or crime. Finally, in the  , emboldened by Conner's apparent death, Abon Duum used the power of the   to travel to Tyr's realm in   to confront Tyr with the  , apparently seeking to seize the power of the gods. However, \"Tyr\" was revealed to be Conner in a cloak, having faked his death and been spirited to Gladsheim. The Catlord stole the   and passed it to Conner, before the real Tyr appeared and took the artifact. With a warning that he would keep an eye on Conner and the scales of justice, he sent the heroes home, while Duum was left to face Justice himself. \n At the onset of the  ,  Tyr's eyes were put out by   for failing to notice the theft of the   and for questioning the justice of Ao's response.  Ilmater, true to his ethos, worked to teach Tyr to live with his blindness and to rely upon his feelings instead,  though in truth they were not a great hindrance in view of his power as a greater god. \n In the  , shortly before the catastrophic events of the  , Tyr and  , who then dwelt in the House of the Triad, had a great disagreement over a battle between   and Calishite forces. The argument was so severe that Siamorphe left the House of the Triad to make her realm with   in  . Tyr sent   as a messenger to Sune to explain his position, and Sune tried to act as a peacemaker. As the goddess of love, she proposed a marriage between Tyr and   as a way to restore balance to the  . Tyr agreed and began a formal courtship with the goddess of good fortune. \n It was suspected that   plotted to corrupt the arrangement, for rumors came to Tyr that Helm, who had been delivering messages from the House of the Triad to Brightwater for Tyr, had been having a secret affair with Tymora and that she loved the god of guardians instead of the god of justice. Tyr believed that the only way to reach the truth of the matter was to challenge Helm to a duel, and Helm felt that it was the honorable act to accept the challenge. \n In the duel that followed, Helm was slain, leading to more chaos in the Celestial realms. Heartbroken, Tymora left Brightwater to be with Tyr out of duty, but Ilmater left the Triad and accepted Sune's invitation to Brightwater. \n More tragedy among the gods shortly followed. In the next year,  , Cyric teamed with   to bring about the death of   and the resulting  . At least this event brought Sune and Tyr onto the same side again, and the two of them, with Lanthander's aid, pursued and captured Cyric, imprisoning him for a sentence of one thousand years. \n After imprisoning Cyric, Tyr abdicated his godhood and granted Torm all his deific power, because the Even-Handed had lost faith in himself and in his ability to lead and judge. Tyr counseled all of his followers to offer their allegiance to Torm.  Tyr's portfolio of justice was subsequently absorbed by  , who later became a subservient deity of Torm. \n At some point, Tyr sent the     into   to try and talk sense into  . Unfortunately,   was able to capture Aryx, and trapped her in a shield in his  . \n At some point between 1385 DR and  , Tyr died fighting off a   invasion of the upper realms in an act of heroic sacrifice. Tyr's absence reinforced the role of Torm as the new master of Celestia. \n Tyr managed to return to life during the event known as the  , in the 1480s DR. \n One of the many ancient aspects of Tyr, Iltyr the Blind but All-Seeing Eye, was still being venerated in secret, even after Tyr's death after the Spellplague. This ancient cult involved a number of   and   nobles and even included some   and   followers. Iltyr was depicted as an entirely black, flying, weeping eyeball with a prehensile tail. Iltyr's hidden shrines, however, often included large portraits that included one or a pair of large but normal staring eyes, which his followers often dismissed to visitors as the only surviving portrait of an ancestor. Iltyr supposedly communicated with followers with a booming, telepathic voice. \n Some suggested that Tyr invented the concept of trial by combat. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tyr"},

The term \"halfling\" was derived from the fact that the average halfling was around half the size of the average human, but otherwise very similar in appearance. \n Halflings were small in comparison with the members of most other races, standing somewhere from 2\u20328\u2033\u20123\u20324\u2033 (81\u2012100\u202fcm) tall and weighing on average between 30\u201235\u202flb (14\u201216\u202fkg).  In many ways, halflings resembled small humans and usually had the same proportions as the typical human adult. Most halflings had dark hair and eyes,  regardless of their skin complexion which, although commonly ruddy in hue  had a similar range to humans. \n Halfling hairstyles were often complex, with strands woven together or braided. Nearly all male halflings were incapable of growing true beards, though many had long sideburns.  There were exceptions, however. For example,   wore a small goatee and moustache.  \n Although halflings had an affinity for collecting valuables, they did not prefer to wear these on their person, instead preferring more comfortable clothing. \n Halflings were by nature joyful and friendly in their dealings with others. Because they lived in a world where they were surrounded by larger creatures, halflings tended to avoid notice, often deliberately, or at the very least, acted cordial towards the larger races. Halflings appeared deceptively harmless, meaning they were often beyond the notice of enemies that might otherwise pose a threat to them. \n The halfling mind was practical and halflings concerned themselves with their immediate surroundings. They took pleasure in simple things, with few aspiring to greatness in the same manner as humans. Some halflings did become adventurers, but usually this was a practice taken up for reasons of necessity rather than personal drive. Because of their love for home and family, halflings made loyal and courageous allies, willing to put their own lives at risk for the sake of others. \n While many halflings did not have the ambition for adventure that some races did, most preferred trouble to boredom; the race was notoriously curious. Halflings were courageous, more so than many races, and their daring was often difficult to match. Many halflings also had a strong appetite for food and drink as well as narcotics and clothing. Similarly, many halflings were enthusiastic collectors, and loved to hold on to possessions won through skill and daring. \n Halflings were quick and dexterous humanoids, even given their size, with quick reflexes and an ability to recover easily from sudden danger. Halflings, who by and large had a strong force of personality, were also intensely courageous and were more likely to retain their valor than most other humanoids, even when under the effects of a   or other power. Beyond this, halflings had what could be best described as a lucky streak, which made it less likely for them to be injured in perilous circumstances. \n Additionally, the small size of halflings had an effect on their abilities. For instance, they were incapable of wielding larger weapons like   or   and could only wield one handed weapons sized for larger creatures, such as   and  , with both hands   \n It was sometimes said that halflings were weaker. As towards other humanoids, and as a trend, halflings tend to be weaker.  However, this was not a universal truth of the race.  Similarly, although many had an excellent sense of hearing, not all did. \n Halfling communities were tightly knit groups found around the world, usually near the settlements of other races. Most halflings didn't recognize the claims of kings or nobles as sovereign rulers but instead looked primarily to their family elders to guide them. This focus on bloodlines enabled halfling traditions to continue for millennia relatively intact.  Halflings also valued a sense of community; halflings naming each other \"halfling\" was a salute of brotherhood. \n Halfling culture had a fondness for stories and legends and was rich in the oral tradition. So much care was put into the retelling of traditional stories and their preservation that halflings often unwittingly had access to lore about ancient and long-gone cultures or empires that others had long since forgotten about. Many halflings were able to recall some detail of the ancient past, though it was usually wrapped in the shrouds of legends. \n Halflings underwent something of a cultural and philosophical change through the  . During this time, the typical halfling aversion to adventure for its own sake was overcome by a powerful sense of wanderlust. Halfling-run adventure companies became common in many major cities of Faer\u00fbn. \n Halflings called the longer times of a day by how far the sun traveled in the sky and shorter moments like up to three minutes \"A long tune\" and around ten minutes \"3 long songs\". \n Halfling children were known to fish for   using a light, durable twine string, and bait of live  . \n . The halfling race had many traditional homelands, though as a whole the race was typically nomadic.  Many halflings who did not wander lived primarily within human-dominated states.  By the 1370s DR, halflings made up about half or more of the population of the city of Secomber in the   and the town of   on the  . \n The center of halfling culture was, until relatively recently, the kingdom of  . The land was devastated by the   however,  as were other halfling homelands such as   and the  .  Since then the halflings became more displaced than before,  though as a result they also came together in unity even more tightly than they were before.  There was also a sizable kingdom of hin called  , located in the forest on the eastern slopes of the   mountain range in the  . The folk of Delmyr were isolationists and lived much more in tune with nature. \n Since then, halflings were found in their greatest concentrations within the nation of  . Though formerly met with prejudice, halflings earned acceptance through their skill as merchants and business partners. Halflings could also be commonly found along the  , particularly human-dominated cities.  In fact, human cities were often the most common place to find halflings, who frequently found ways to exploit the ever-changing climate of human societies, although dwarven cities were also accommodating. \n The hin generally avoided realms where slavery was prevalent or those where exploitation of their kind was socially acceptable. As of the 1370s DR, this included the lands of  ,  ,  , and  , as well as cities such as  ,  , and  . The people of   and the     were actively prejudicial toward halflings and did not allow them to infiltrate their lands. \n It was said that \" ,  ,   and more cheese are what fill a happy Hin's stomach.\" and that could be evidenced by their own agricultural choices in places like   and  . Sometimes the Hin made food goods for humans, among these were sausages, cheeses, stews, and baked goods. Halflings themselves liked those foods as well, but made them chewier and more rubbery for their tastes, with no strong  , but instead using melding herbs. When Hin were left to their own devices, they produced flavored cheeses, sour grape wines, \"blue eyes\" (blue grapes), sour table grapes, and goat and sheep meats and their  . In winter, the Hin had two stews ready all day; one lighter broth, and the other filled with more sustenance. \n Named special halfling foods:\n Halflings, in general, tried their best to get along with everybody and managed to do so with most other races.    and   were friendly, outgoing, and uncommonly adept at fitting into communities of humans,  ,  , or  . Most halflings, in fact, didn't live in communities of their own but instead regions dominated by other races.  It should be noted that halflings usually found insults directed at them to be amusing rather than insulting. \n Exceptions to the general rule of halfling amenability did exist, and   were notoriously xenophobic.  \n Halflings had lifespans comparable with, but slightly longer than, humans. A halfling was typically considered an adult in their early twenties and some lived into their 150s. \n There were several subraces of halflings, as follows: \n Halfling history was, by and large, like the race, unremarkable. With the exception of the Strongheart nation of  , halflings did not even have a unified culture to call their own. Records and evidence seemed to indicate that halflings, as a race, only appeared fairly recently, and after the appearance of the  , around the same time as dwarves, elves, and giants. The original homeland of halflings is uncertain, though it may have been within the area south of the   and few were seen in the north until after the  , a tragic event that split the halflings into their current three breeds. \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halfling"},

Seen from Toril, it appeared to fit within the size of a   fist held at arm's length. It was quite bright on a clear night, able to cast pale shadows. \n Sel\u00fbne was about 2,000\u202fmiles  (3,200\u202fkilometers) across  and was located 183,000\u202fmiles  (295,000\u202fkilometers) away from Toril,  although some sages from the late 14  century   claimed the distance to be some 20,000\u202fmiles  (32,000\u202fkilometers) instead. \n Since the revolution and rotation periods of Sel\u00fbne's orbit around Toril were the same, only one side of the moon always faced Toril, while the far side (referred to by some as the \"dark side\") could never be seen from the planet. \n The visible side of the moon was disguised by a powerful   that made it appear to be an airless, barren, desolate place filled with craters and valleys. The illusion drifted about 500 miles (800 km) above the surface. It could only be revealed by a   spell and, even so, only to the caster. The far side, however, was not obscured by any magic, so its true splendor could be seen from space. All docking ports for   ships were located on the far side. \n Sel\u00fbne was followed in the sky by the  , a constellation of very small celestial bodies that was often identified as composed of nine stars,  but which in reality consisted of hundreds of asteroids. \n Sel\u00fbne was full at midnight on  ,  , and subsequently every 30 days, 10 hours, and 30 minutes. Sel\u00fbne was also full at midnight on the first day of every leap year. Sel\u00fbne made exactly 48   revolutions every four years, so the phase of Sel\u00fbne was the same at the same time on the same date every four years. Sel\u00fbne was generally full around the first day of each month, give or take a day; festival days served to keep the moon's phases consistent across calendar months and years. \n For those who practiced  , the phase of the moon affected the potency of their spells, peaking in the full moon and dipping at the new moon. \n Due to the size and relative rotation of Sel\u00fbne and Toril, eclipses were quite frequent and commonplace. \n 60\u2009\u2109 16\u2009\u2103 Max 32\u2009\u2109 0\u2009\u2103 Min The surface of Sel\u00fbne had enormous lakes and two large seas. It was dotted with cities connected with one another by beautifully decorated roads. Three large mountain ranges ran along the surface of the moon from North to South. The mountaintops of the twelve tallest mountains were constantly molten and gathered heat from   during the moon's 15-day-long day. As they cooled down, they shone an incandescent light that was bright enough to read by during most of the moon's 15-day-long night. \n Sel\u00fbne had a remarkably stable temperature, thanks to its magical blanket. Except for the hot mountain tops, the surface of the entire moon was relatively cool, although temperatures never dropped below freezing. \n The native vegetation required low temperatures of below 60\u202f   (16\u202f ). Known in Faer\u00fbn as \"moonplants\", a whole garden of them was carefully maintained in a sensitive ecosystem under the Dome of the Moon atop the   temple to the goddess in  . \n By the hand of  , goddess of the moon and its namesake, the moon could be a conduit of her powers.

The evil sea goddess transformed him into a bubble in retaliation, one that rose far above the ocean waves and into the skies above, forever separating the two lovers. This bubble became what surface dwellers referred to as the \"full moon\". The Sel\u00fbnite clergy made efforts to educate the Ser\u00f4sians on the moon's connection with Sel\u00fbne, but they continued to cling to this old myth well into the 14  century  . \n The largest and most beautiful building on Sel\u00fbne was the  , located in the center of the moon's far side. It consisted of about 50   space docks and was surrounded by numerous colorful businesses, theaters, and dwellings. Visitors from Toril arriving at this large complex were usually confined to it and were not allowed to explore the remainder of the moon. \n Sel\u00fbne's aloof inhabitants, also known as  , but who referred to themselves as  , had a refined sense of aesthetics that appeared frivolous and foolish to outsiders. The predominant religion among the moon's inhabitants was the worship of  . In fact, it was not uncommon for the inhabitants to call their world Leira instead of Sel\u00fbne. The obscuring illusion that hid the near side of the moon from Toril was a gift from Leira to reward their worship. \n Sel\u00fbnians were extremely suspicious of Torilians, to the point of paranoia. Visitors and merchants from Toril were usually considered spies and were often denied access to restricted areas of the moon, sometimes being even confined to the spaceport where they docked. Sel\u00fbnians were convinced that Torilians were dangerous and could not be persuaded otherwise.  They even feared the Torilians would invade their world at any time, despite having no evidence for this belief and despite all the evidence against it. They would launch a \"preemptive counterattack\" on Toril if the opportunity arose. \n Their leader in the late 14  century DR was High Magistrate and Queen of the Leirans  , who had wizards working for her who would track visitors to the moon. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sel%C3%BBne_(moon)"},

They were commonly called  .  In the   of  ,  , and  , Sel\u00fbne was known as Lucha, She Who Guides, and her worship was part of belief in the  . \n The highest principle of Sel\u00fbne's ethos was acceptance and tolerance. She bade the faithful to encourage and exemplify acceptance, equality and equal access, tolerance, and understanding; to treat all other beings as equals; and to make all welcome in the faith.  Fellow Sel\u00fbnites were treated as dear friends and were to be aided freely.  They were to be as helpful and friendly to lonely and good people as was feasible.  Taught to be compassionate, they were usually patient and accepting of everybody, with an understanding ear and a healing hand. \n Worshipers were also urged to be humble and self-reliant, to use common sense and practicality,  and to find their own practical paths through life to be as successful as possible while not neglecting their compassion for others. This long-sighted approach allowed priests to grow content, happy, and prominent, and saw the clergy gain influence and strength.  Indeed, in Durpar, they believed Lucha would guide her worshipers to the most profitable customers.  Sel\u00fbne made few demands on her followers and was lenient on issues of alignment and religious observance,  so practical, common sense and following one's own path were more important than details of faith or strict performance of ritual. \n The goddess taught guidance through observation of the heavens  and that life changed like the moon waxed and waned.  As every force in the world ebbed and flowed, she encouraged her followers to never lose faith or lose hope, yet still struggle to hold back the tide of evil and bring light to the darkness. \n The church had an ideology of female empowerment. Women were honored for their roles as teachers and as role models in society and in the family. Sel\u00fbnite doctrine implied that   had a subtle effect on the natural cycles of the female body; at a full moon, a female cleric felt closest to the goddess.   was seen as a symbol of motherhood and the sustaining power of the feminine.  Followers of Lucha believed she watched over all marriages performed by her clergy. \n The goddess exhorted the faithful to find those who carried the curse of  , and to cure those who desired release from it and to destroy those who surrendered to the beast inside. \n Sel\u00fbnites had their own terms for night-time conditions. When the moon was out, even if not visible, it was known as \"moonlight\". When the moon was dark or not out, it was known as \"nightgloom\". \n There were broadly two kinds of Sel\u00fbnite clergy: those who remained at the temples (often but not necessarily due to age or infirmity), and those who wandered  . Their duties were similar but distinct. \n Temple priests provided healing to the community and tended to the residents of asylums and sanitariums, which often adjoined their temples. As the goddess bade them, they were generous with their healing magic and charged very little for it.  Instead, the temple priests made good money by practicing   and telling fortunes. With divine guidance, they were more successful than ordinary folk. \n Itinerant priests spread the faith by seeking out and keeping in touch with both existing and potential worshipers, in the belief that Sel\u00fbne could be worshiped anywhere.  Such priests also provided healing, usually asking for nothing more than a meal and a warm place to rest.  They practiced humility and self-reliance.  These habits kept the clergy well-traveled, resilient, and in touch with the natural world in a practical manner. \n Wandering priests also kept watch for people afflicted with madness or lycanthropy. They would heal or help them if they could, or else escort them to the closest Sel\u00fbnite temple, where senior clerics could aid them.  Both kinds of priests were united in opposing evil lycanthropes when they threatened a community. They were fearless and did all they could to uncover, cure, or eliminate the affliction of lycanthropy. Such struggles won them the respect of farmers and the common people. \n In Durpar in the Shining Lands, almost all marriages were conducted by priests of Lucha, as it was believed that the goddess watched over all marriages performed by her priests. \n With the faith of Sel\u00fbne promoting equality and understanding for all, and with her wide assortment of worshipers, her priesthood were just as diverse and eclectic.  Nevertheless, the great majority of members were women,  and the senior ranks were dominated by female  .  There were also a scattered few  , both natural and afflicted, but all of good heart.  They all worshiped Sel\u00fbne in their own personal ways,  but whatever their differences they were friendly to one another and cooperated in relative but boisterous peace.  However, with such variety, they could divide into many different factions; the order of silver ladies was established to better accommodate them. \n Suiting the goddess's chaotic and changeable ways, the church hierarchy was highly variable, shifting from place to place and even with the predictable phase of the moon and other, unpredictable heavenly events.  It was a jumble of clerics and specialty priests, crusaders and mystics, and blessed or well-informed lay worshipers.  The silverstar specialty priests were elite members of the church. \n The clergy of Sel\u00fbne were known collectively as \"Sel\u00fbnites\", which was also the adjective for the faith. \n The clergy held a wide assortment of titles. Novices were always known as the Called, while a full priest was known as Priestess or Priest, typically prefaced by Touched, Enstarred, Moonbathed, Silverbrow, Lunar, Initiate, and High Initiate, in order of increasing rank. Higher-ranked clergy were instead known as \"Priestess/Priest of the\u2026\" followed by a term traditional to the shrine or temple with which the priest was affiliated. For example, Priestess of the High Moonlight   was high priestess of the House of the Moon in Waterdeep. Such was the case in the time of Netheril and in the great temples of cities like Waterdeep in the 14  century DR, but there were many variations at country shrines and temples and in other lands. \n The   were called  , in both the time of Netheril and in the 14  century DR. \n The church of Sel\u00fbne commonly included among its ranks  , the elite   known as  ,  , and  .  In the time of Netheril, however, the spellcasting clergy were only silverstars.  Clerics and specialty priests alike were able to   like many other good and neutral priests.  From 1372 DR, clerics would often also train as   or  , or become silverstars.  After this time, silverstars were the prestigious champions of the faith.  Other clergy could be   and  .  There were also a number of lay worshipers who could not cast spells and had no special talents. \n In the time of Netheril, all clergy were good-aligned, but by the 14  century DR they widened to include neutral members.  After 1372 DR, clerics were   or similar. \n The church of Sel\u00fbne was associated with a number of religious orders:\n The church was also affiliated with the  . \n moonfire The diverse faithful all paid homage to Sel\u00fbne in their own individual ways, often adapting the standard rituals into very personalized, even unique rites.  However, there were still many commonalities and shared matters of faith. Many rituals revered a woman's role as a teacher and role model, both in the home and in society. Milk, a sacred fluid, was a vital holy substance in ceremonies.  Rituals often involved offerings of   or   and dancing, and were performed as personal matters.  Followers of the Moonmaiden would often set bowls of milk outside on nights when the moon was full. \n Clerics prayed for their   at night while facing the moon, if it was out and visible. \n During the full moon, a female cleric would perform morning ceremonies to make herself receptive to special insights, intuition, and visions. This was in the belief that the moon subtly influenced the cycles of the female body, and thus she felt closest to Sel\u00fbne during the full moon. \n A regular ritual was the \"night stalk\", as it was often known, an occasion for worship and communion with the goddess, in which the clergy reaffirmed their nearness to the Night White Lady.  This could be just a simple solitary night-time walk under the moonlight, hence its name.  More involved ceremonies involved dances under the open sky and prayers in the moonlight, with libations of milk and wine over a central altar. These were held on the nights of every full moon and new moon.  For example, High Initiate   would pour milk and wine over a  -inlaid altar, then dance while chanting a prayer. She would be mimicked by junior clerics, who felt honored to participate. They could even dance until they collapsed in exhaustion. \n If the goddess was pleased by a ceremony, she bathed the milk or wine poured on the altar with moonlight, transforming it into a holy substance known as  . This crept away from the altar to touch or envelop whatever the goddess chose, in turn enchanting items, empowering the faithful, and destroying  .  When   appeared, the clergy considered it a good sign, believing the night was blessed and they were worthy. Those it touched were thought to be marked for a special destiny. \n The most sacred rituals, observed by all clergy, were the Mystery of the Night, an annual holy day, and the rare Conjuring of the Second Moon. \n The Mystery of the Night was the most sacred ritual; every priest was required to perform it at least once a year. The priests cast certain secret spells then prostrated themselves before an altar, where they fell into a deep trance. Then they flew upwards, to spiral around the night sky and even to circle the moon. Meanwhile, they communed and communicated personally with Sel\u00fbne through mental visions. This was draining and injurious, but easily healed with time or magic. \n The Conjuring of the Second Moon was conducted only on  , a day that occurred once every four years. Every Shieldmeet, at every temple to Sel\u00fbne in Faer\u00fbn, the clergy chanted in coordination and the confluence of their devotional energy summoned the  , the   servants of the goddess. For one night only, the Shards would do as the clergy bade them, most often to combat the minions and dark forces of  . However, at dawn the next day, the Shards elevated one mortal priestess to their ranks, before they departed for the  . \n Suiting the changeable and individual nature of both church and goddess, the holy sites of Sel\u00fbne varied across the land. They ranged from simple shrines, such as those in the   and oft in the wilderness, to amazing opulent temples like the House of the Moon in Waterdeep. There were also humble hermitages, hilltop circles in which worshipers danced in the night, and ornate temple mansions, which were huge edifices with open-air courtyards or great skylights. Nevertheless, there was a widespread preference for smaller shrines and individual worship.  Common features were feminine symbols, small gardens, and reflecting ponds.  Sel\u00fbnite temples were often adjoined by asylums and sanitariums, the residents of which the clergy cared for. \n Although the church had no central base, its greatest and most magnificent temple was the   in   in the 14  century DR. Because of it, much Sel\u00fbnite activity took place in Waterdeep and its environs. \n In the  , where Sel\u00fbne was known as Lucha, the city of   was a hub of her faith. The folk here favored the worship of She Who Guides. \n The legendary city of  , lying somewhere in  , was founded as a whole city of Sel\u00fbne's faithful. Though it fell into the grip of evil beings, Sel\u00fbnites still hoped to liberate and restore it. \n The symbol of the church was the   of the goddess: a pair of eyes, of a darkly beautiful human woman, encircled by seven silver stars.  This was typically carved into or out of moonstone and fashioned into an item of jewelry. \n The original ceremonial dress of the priests of Sel\u00fbne during the time of Netheril consisted of white robes, which could be either plain and unadorned or embroidered with   and decorated with moonstones; a circlet of woven flowers or vines worn around the head; and no shoes. A high priest carried as their symbol of office a wooden staff wrapped with silver, including silver flowers and vines, and topped with a moonstone.  By the 14  century DR, the priests of Lucha in the Shining Lands still wore white robes, circlets of flowers and vines, and no shoes, while priests carried staffs wrapped with flowers and vines.  In the city of  , young acolytes of   wore blue and silver robes. \n Meanwhile, the later priests of Sel\u00fbne had highly variable ceremonial costumes. The most humble wore plain brown robes, while others wore normal clothes accented with but a little moonstone jewelry. The grandest and haughtiest wore only the very finest attire, such as expensive gowns bedecked with jewels, with magical and animated capes and trains, and crowns set with moonstones. For example, Naneatha Suaril, high priestess of the House of the Moon in Waterdeep, presided over ceremonies in a majestic dress with a wide-bottomed hooped skirt and a great fan-like collar ascending from the back of her neck, both stiffened with  , all set with clusters of   and other precious stones. \n In everyday life, Sel\u00fbnites wore fashionable but not gaudy attire. In their work, they adopted whatever was practical for the task at hand. \n In battle, Sel\u00fbnites preferred a certain kind of   they called \"the  \".  A Moon's Hand had a smooth head  representing the moon in a specific phase. Each temple had its own preferred phase for their Moon's Hands.  It was otherwise identical to a typical  ,   , or  , with the clergy favoring the heavy mace. \n The goddess was generous with her gifts. \n The clergy gathered \" \", the holy essence of Sel\u00fbne  that fell from her  ,  , and manifestations  or were believed to fall from the  , the asteroids that trailed the moon.  They prized these, for they were a powerful ingredient in many beneficial   and healing drafts and ointments.  Some Selenite priestesses proved their devotion in going above and beyond while performing decrees of the church, as rewards and dedicated tools, they were gifted  , powerful translucent  , especially deadly to the  . \n The holy substance called   could, at the goddess's direction, envelop and enchant items to create a variety of magic items for use by the clergy. These included: \n A number of   and prayers were unique to Sel\u00fbnite priests or were closely associated with them:\n Clerics, druids, and rangers initiated into the higher secrets of the church could choose all these spells and were greatly skilled in casting   and  . \n The eternal war between Sel\u00fbne and Shar was waged through their servitor creatures and mortal worshipers and thus their respective religions, reflecting the unending tension between good and light versus evil and dark. Hence, the church of Sel\u00fbne had been war with the   since their beginnings. When followers of each faith encountered one another, open battle invariably broke out. \n Most good folk of Faer\u00fbn respected the Sel\u00fbnite clergy, though few understood the details of the faith. Common people saw them as mysterious, but knew them as a force of good and foes of werebeasts and undead, and as caretakers of the ill and the mad. \n In Durpar, the clergy of Lucha enjoyed the worship of almost everyone in the land. They struggled tirelessly against the followers of   and other dark deities. \n The Sel\u00fbnite religion was an ancient one in Faer\u00fbn. \n Sel\u00fbne was worshiped by the Netherese in the ancient empire of  .  A temple dedicated to Sel\u00fbne, the  , was established in  . \n In the  , the   came,   went awry, and the   were forced to walk the Realms in mortal form. One night, a purported   of Sel\u00fbne arrived in Waterdeep and summoned the faithful to the House of the Moon, where she was welcomed by high priestess Naneatha Suaril. The avatar promised the faithful her grace and protection. However, one did not believe her:  , the true avatar of Sel\u00fbne, who'd come with her friend   to see for herself. As the mob of worshipers and then the temple guards subdued Vajra, Luna confronted the avatar and the two engaged in a   battle on the steps of the temple. Finally, the priests gave the false avatar the   and she used it to knock out Luna. The temple guards took Luna prisoner at the avatar's direction.  Her true identity as Sel\u00fbne unknown, Luna was kept as a \"special guest\"\u2014prisoner\u2014at the House of the Moon for a dozen days. The false Sel\u00fbne had her completely under her control. \n Learning of this, Luna's friends Vajra,  ,  , and   resolved to rescue her from the temple.  Their infiltration of the temple culminated in a battle with the Lunatics. The heroes unmasked one of Lunatics, expecting the dark goddess Shar but finding none other than a brainwashed Luna.  Witnessing the battle, Naneatha began to question the false Sel\u00fbne, who soon revealed her murderous intent. Learning that Luna was truly Sel\u00fbne and that the false avatar was in fact Shar, Naneatha defiantly shoved her off the temple balcony. Her near self-sacrifice bought time for Luna and her friends to escape the temple.  Later that night, Luna transformed fully into an avatar of Sel\u00fbne, and famously battled Shar over the streets of Waterdeep, her light blasting away Shar's darkness.  It became a local legend of the faithful that during the Time of Troubles Sel\u00fbne battled Shar in Waterdeep,  hurling her down amongst the city's spires. \n Following the   of 1358 DR, with her waxing faith, theologians of the 1360s DR predicted Sel\u00fbne would once again be elevated among the gods, possibly within their own lifetimes. \n In the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, the clergy grew in strength. To atone for being tricked by Shar, Naneatha launched a crusade against Shar's followers and drove them out of the city by  . Naneatha also firmly supported the establishment of the  , dedicated to both Sel\u00fbne and  . \n After the   happened in the  , Sel\u00fbne became a popular deity across Faer\u00fbn, as her priesthood made pilgrimages to every corner of the continent, wanting to bring hope to people in those desperate times. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_Sel%C3%BBne"},

The Queen of Spiders had these eight limbed abominations infiltrate   societies, normally undetected. \n Yochlols had four forms available to them:  ,\u00a0 ,  , and gaseous. \n In their natural form yochlols were 6\u20127\u202fft (1.8\u20122.1\u202fm) tall and weighed 250\u202flb  (110\u202fkg).  Their yellow, oozy, bodies\u00a0seemed to be constantly melting and piling back up like a sickening living candle.  This waxy exterior constantly effused a foul stench.\u00a0They were visually akin to  , with eight\u00a0writhing, powerful tentacles and\u00a0a pillar-like main body with a single, sinister, scarlet eye in the middle. \n Their most seen form, however,\u00a0was that of an attractive, slender   or   female, normally a  . This form could not be crafted in such a way as to replicate other individuals, and was around 6 inches taller than typical for a member of that race. They could not morph clothes and so had to keep some nearby when entering this form. \n Yochlols could also become giant arachnids with a leg span of 8\u202fft  (2.4\u202fm) and weighing 160\u202flb  (73\u202fkg). This man-sized form appeared to be a massive   with a pair of dangerous fangs. \n Yochlol were visually similar to   in many ways, particularly in their ability to take on a gaseous appearance.  This form was a green cloud of murky smoke vaguely similar to that of its true form. It had the same pillar like body 10\u202fft  (3\u202fm) high and 5\u202fft  (1.5\u202fm) wide in diameter, and could manifest several pseudopods at will.  Their oily vapor was still just as malodorous as the reeking of their sludge form. \n Yochlols were a behavioral anomaly in the ranks of demonic beings: Though they delighted in cruelty and combat, relishing domination of other creatures, they were also known to make genuine friendships, often building them with charismatic mortals; however, as Lolth's chosen, their arrival was hated and feared by other demons, who were not permitted to attack them. Sadly, a yochlol's friendship or even love often led to their loved ones being persecuted by those who disliked the yochlol. \n The exact nature of the kinship was not properly understood due to the strange backwards nature of their relations. Yochlols had a tendency to abandon partners whose acquaintances weren't bothered by their presence, yet the persecution of these companions caused yochlols to furiously vent their anger on the perpetrators; however, they did not mourn the death of their partners. Some theorized that yochlol enjoyed the downfall of these individuals under their relationship but yochlol never betrayed their lovers and raged when they died. \n Unlike other demons yochlols did not have rivalries amongst themselves, for they did not view each other as competition; indeed, handmaidens readily and eagerly cooperated with each other under the common goal of serving Lolth. Unless Lolth's enemies were present, yochlols did not engage in killing sprees or frenzies of mindless violence. Ironically, despite their ability to get along with their own kind and even other mortals, they were contemptuous of other demons, rarely associating with them, and, rare among demons, cared little about the state of the  , but only for their mistress. \n The abilities of a yochlol were dependent on their current state, but some were consistent throughout their various forms. Within seconds they could transform from their current form to any of their others. At all times yochlol were protected from having their minds read by an effect similar to  , both hiding their thoughts and true alignment. A slew of magical and   abilities made yochlol even more dangerous than they already were. Charming and domination magic, as well as the ability to read minds, made it incredibly difficult to socially outgun them. In all their corporeal forms, they were somewhat spider-like, able to create webs, navigate them, and climb on walls. If in particular danger, there was half a chance they could call a second yochlol for aid to escape the threat. With the favor of Lolth, yochlol had a minor divine protection from harm, making them even more difficult to injure.  They reverted to their waxy selves upon death, thus revealing the nature of their being. \n Their repertoire of psionic powers included all manner of psionic defense modes,  particularly   and  ,  as well as the psionic attack modes  ,  ,  and  . The other psionic powers possible of them were primarily of the    .  These included  ,   (though only usable in their humanoid form),   ,   ,   ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  and  . \n In either humanoid or true form a yochlol's touch was as venomous as that of a spider's fangs.  Within their arachnid forms their true fangs were laid bare and it was far easier for them to use their more spider-like powers. This was often the form they used when traversing webs and attempting to poison their opponents. While in the form of a toxic mist however yochlol were capable of flight, and slipping through any airtight space. They could fly near living beings and force them to breathe their noxious forms in, causing them illness. They could not be harmed in this state by non-magical weapons that simply passed right through them.  This was also the only form in which they could contact their home plane in for further advice. \n The yochlol's prowess in shapechanging gave them a great variety of versatility in matters of combat.  Yochlol in their natural forms slammed\u00a0away at their foes with their numerous tentacles, the noxious gas forcing opponents to either stay away or find some other means to attack it. Yochlol were more likely, however, to be found in their humanoid form since it was capable of using weapons, thus granting them greater tactical flexibility, and they'd typically only abandon that form when they knew someone was nearby to pick up their armor and weapons. Drow form allowed them to more easily convince other beings to cooperate using their psionic abilities, as they would more readily trust this form as opposed to that of a melting monstrosity. \n Most yochlol trained to enhance their abilities, sometimes as   and   (though not as   since Lolth discouraged the practice)  but most often as  . Bards were often welcome in the halls of nobility, furthering the yochlol's infiltration ability. \n Fighting alone was rarely their plan, as their mental manipulation abilities gave them access to servants to protect them. They prioritized their mission objective above their own lives, and would make whatever sacrifice necessary to complete it. Their second greatest priority laid somewhere between themselves, other yochlol, and any other beings they had befriended.  Despite these prerogatives, they still relished battle and\u00a0often hissed, whispered,\u00a0screamed, or even told their names in combat to make any potential escapee\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bfear its return.\u200b\u200b \n Two of the yochlol's forms. Yochlols\u00a0were most numerous in their abyssal layer of origin, the  . Within it they commonly served as Lolth's enforcers, scouts, and appropriately as handmaidens. When on other layers of the Abyss they were normally in disguise performing espionage on other demonic powers. Because most demons, including demon lords like   and  , knew that yochlol exclusively worked for Lolth they normally gave them a wide berth. The Spider Queen's minions were only interfered with rarely, as yochlol were one of the few demons with near universal close relations to their master, allowed to roam the layers of the Abyss uninhibited. Lolth's reputation of giving great rewards to her most effective servants certainly applied to yochlols, and greater versions of their race did exist. \n Only high priestesses of the Queen of Spiders were told how to summon a yochlol to the  . They were only supposed to be called upon in dire need or to witness sacrifices in the name of their dark goddess.\u200b  This was when they were not infiltrating drow civilizations, whether in the open or in secret.  Lolth used yochlols to spy on the drow and ensure they were worshiping her properly.\u200b \u00a0They also worked under drow matrons either as assassins, advisors, or even lovers in some cases. Yochlols were also used as a channel of communication to and from the Abyss.  Some of Lolth's most faithful believed they would be reincarnated into yochlol if they devoted themselves completely to her.  When summoned by anyone that wasn't a high priestess or above they faithfully served their caller for one task, as decreed by Lolth,\u00a0before attempting to escape to the Material Plane whether or not it was agreed upon. It was at these points when they infiltrated non-drow societies and plotting cunning schemes to turn their residents evil. \n Unlike most demons yochlol seemed to need food to survive, at least every twenty days. This could take the form of gasses and liquids, preferably blood, in their gaseous form or flesh in a more solid state. Eating was done normally in humanoid form, by envelopment in natural form, and by absorption in gas form. In any state the bones and other hard matter consumed was left behind, either harmlessly and quickly pushed out in physical forms or simply falling to the ground when gaseous. There was a clear preference of living prey among yochlol. \n For a long time it was unknown how Lolth created her handmaidens, with only rumors circulating among planar travelers. It turned out that through a series of unknown tortures and dark ceremonies, Lolth created the yochlol from   that she captured from layers of the  , somewhat explaining their mental domination abilities and seductive skill. These newly created yochlol remembered nothing of their former life and were completely loyal to their new mistress, although it was unknown if this loyalty was programmed in or due to extreme fear.\u00a0This process did not need to be conducted by Lolth herself, but she and her closest consorts were the only one with knowledge of how to conduct it. If the secret were to leak and spread throughout the Abyss there would be nothing stopping the yochlol from diversifying into several different tanar'ri themselves. \n Yochlol essence (made from heating part of its gaseous form or boiling down part of its physical form) was used in spell inks and castings related to abilities of yochlols, such as   and  . \n Within the Demonweb were several Crystal Towers of Yochlol, giant pillar-like rocks held within the silk\u00a0that housed numerous portals to other worlds. They were staffed by nine yochlol each who not only protected the portals but interrogated particularly important subjects brought by drow. \n A yochlol was the one to tell the drow to settle  . \n In  , during the attack of the drow on  , a yochlol was summoned to aid in the battle.

He stood about 5\u202ffeet and 4\u202finches (1.6\u202fmeters) tall and weighed about 130\u202fpounds  (59\u202fkilograms).  His handsome features were sharp and well proportioned and, like other drow, Drizzt's skin was black and his stark white hair was long, thick, and flowing. His eyes were a lavender hue (quite different from the drow race's typical red, even when he used his  , which normally caused eyes to glow red) and seemed to glow fiercely when he was angry or determined. \n His vision was once accustomed to the pitch-blackness of the  . However, many years after Drizzt first ventured onto the surface, his eyes adapted to the bright light of the world above. When using his infravision, the images, if held for a prolonged period of time, caused headaches and other symptoms of strain. \n He normally wore a forest-green cloak that was given to him by the   upon his departure to  , high black boots, and a necklace attached to a white   head, the symbol of his goddess,  , the goddess of rangers. This symbol was crafted for him by his good friend   from   (the bone of the   found in Icewind Dale). \n A perfectionist by nature, Drizzt had high ideals and standards to which he strove to conform, though he didn't hold others to the same. He was sensitive and thoughtful and longed to be accepted among others and to make friends everywhere. However, he was always troubled by the threat his enemies would pose to such newfound friends and he was always wary of betrayal and dangers. He was taciturn and terse of speech, but still polite to others.  He credited   for imparting cultural awareness and tolerance upon him. \n In his later years, Drizzt's goal was perfection of the body with his blades in battle.  Drizzt did not want his god to dictate his actions; he had to agree with those actions himself. \n On relatively rare occasions, Drizzt regressed into a bestial and instinctive state of mind that he identified as the \"Hunter\". The first time this happened was after Drizzt had fled from   and was living in the wilds of the  . For those ten years, he came close to being completely overwhelmed by this animalistic personality, but began learning to master it when he came close to harming some   children.  In the heat of battle, when his friends seemed to be in great danger or when he was alone in the wilderness, Drizzt would occasionally lose control over himself or give in to the urges of the Hunter, such as when he went back to his homeland to prevent harm from coming to his friends.  Another example was when, during the war with King   and his horde of orcs, Drizzt had thought   dead, and wasn't certain if his other friends were alive. \n As a drow, Drizzt was innately able to summon globes of impenetrable magical   at will in an area or attached to a target. He could also summon a harmless  , purple flames that did not burn but could be seen and outlined a target, making it easier to spot,  even if the target turned invisible. \n After Drizzt studied under   for six months in  , Masoj acknowledged that if Drizzt had chosen to become a wizard, he would have become quite a powerful one indeed. \n Drizzt fought in the two long-weapon style common among drow warriors. When tides turned bad, or when facing opponents such as   or  , he conjured a globe of darkness that neither he nor his opponent could see through.  Depending on the situation, Drizzt continued the fight from in there. In rare cases, Drizzt would go into a self-imposed trance. \n When chasing someone or unable to see his prey, Drizzt often called upon his innate abilities to surround his target with  . He used this ability when on the boat with Captain   and fighting the pirate   and his lackeys.  He also used them when he,  , and   fought a group of seven  , even as they started to disappear. \n He also had to cope with his racial weakness to light, having a slight aversion to it, so if a great light source was brought upon him unexpectedly it could cause temporary disorientation. \n Drizzt's favorite weapon was the  , and he carried two, nicknamed   and  . He also carried a unique   that summoned his black   companion  .  The drow wore a pair of   (obtained from  , weapon master of the first house of Menzoberranzan who challenged and lost to Drizzt) around his ankles, which made him incredibly quick on his feet. He chose to wear them on his legs instead of his arms because when the enchantment combined with his natural speed, his sword swings became too fast for him to control (making it hard to change directions), and his feet could not keep up, resulting in extremely predictable attacks. \n Drizzt's attire generally took the form of a cloth tunic, tough pants, soft boots and leather gloves.    was an enchanted suit of    , made by  . \n Drizzt carried   during his journeys in  . \n He was known to use   and a   hidden in each boot. \n Catti-brie occasionally lent Drizzt her bow  , such as when he visited Silverymoon in the  .  While   was injured during Drizzt's battles with the frost giants in the attempt to take Mithral Hall by King Obould, Drizzt wielded   and its  's never-ending supply of lightning arrows, which he still had in his possession a hundred years later. He also mastered and wielded   in a fight with Obould Many-Arrows but left it stuck in him, who later tossed the blade into a ravine, where the drow   found it.  Drizzt attempted to return   to Catti-brie when they were reunited, but she preferred her magic. \n Later acquisitions included a whistle that summoned a magical unicorn that Drizzt named   and a   attuned to  , taken from the severed finger of  . \n Born in  , on the night   destroyed  , the death of   at the hands of   saved Drizzt from being sacrificed to Lolth. He was trained by his sister,  , and his father,  . He attended the  , where he became an unsurpassed victor after his third year for seven years running, even against students three years ahead of him. By secretly refusing to kill a  , Drizzt caused House Do'Urden to lose Lolth's favor, resulting in Zaknafein being sacrificed.  While Zaknafein was sacrificed, Drizzt encountered   and   Menzoberranzan, after sneaking outside House Do'Urden. The two fought with Drizzt, using Masoj's summoned panther Guenhwyvar, unaware of Drizzt's bond with her. Guenhwyvar decided to disobey Masoj's commands and slew Alton while Drizzt killed Masoj and claimed Masoj's onyx figurine, the object used to summon Guenhwyvar from the  . On returning to House Do'Urden, Drizzt discovered Zaknafein's sacrifice to Lolth and then escaped. He decided to live outside Menzoberranzan as a rogue to escape the endless cycle of killing. \n Drizzt escaped Menzoberranzan and became a wanderer in the Underdark for ten years before discovering   and Dinin searching for him. Realizing they were tracking him through his House emblem, he passed it to Guenhwyvar to misdirect the Do'Urden soldiers, before knocking out Dinin and confronting Briza. Briza claimed that their mother was going to welcome him back home, when in fact they intended to sacrifice him to regain Lolth's favor, but foolishly named him the new weapons master, causing him to furiously remind her of Zaknafein's murder. Though he cut off some of her fingers, he refused to kill her because of his vow to never kill another drow. \n Nearly driven mad by solitude, Drizzt sought refuge in  .  In Blingdenstone, Drizzt was reunited with the svirfneblen  , whom Drizzt had saved during a raid on a svirfneblen mining operation led by Belwar, who had lost his hands after Dinin Do'Urden ordered Drizzt to cut them off during the raid. Shortly after, the two headed back into the Underdark because of Zaknafein hunting Drizzt as a   controlled by Matron Malice. The two soon met  , a   turned  , who was later slain by Zaknafein. In the final face-off, Drizzt bested his father, who, having a moment of clarity, knew the only way to prevent the zin-carla from continuing to hunt Drizzt was to destroy his body in a pool of  . \n Understanding that he would never find peace in the Underdark, Drizzt headed back to Blingdenstone with Belwar, where Drizzt parted ways with him and headed towards the surface. \n Drizzt arrived on the surface outside of  , a small village north of  , near the farm of the   family. He soon encountered a band of  , who assumed him to be an ally, but was forced to kill them after learning they intended to raid the farm. Being unfamiliar with the customs of the surface, Drizzt resolved to study the Thistledowns while acting as their secret guardian. One day, while shadowing the youngest child,  , Drizzt ended up revealing himself to the boy and tried to introduce himself, but Liam ran away scared, calling him a \"drizzit\". Later, when Liam brought his other siblings to prove the existence of the \"drizzit\", Drizzt made another attempt to befriend them, but   mistook him for a threat and attempted to attack him but the drow easily disarmed him and offered his sword back in the drow custom of friendship, but the children instead ran away terrified. \n The encounter was reported back to the people of Maldobar, who amassed a hunting party to verify Drizzt's presence. Drizzt attempted to misdirect them by sending out Guenhwyvar, but the hunter   wasn't fooled. McGristle soon discovered Drizzt after the     stole one of his scimitars on orders of the   named  . Acting in self-defense, Drizzt was forced to kill one of McGristle's   before escaping. McGristle accidentally felled a tree that scarred his ear, an act he would irrationally blame on Drizzt. \n Afterwards, Drizzt continued to monitor the Thistledown home and later ventured inside out of concern for the lack of activity, only to discover that Ulgulu had massacred them in revenge for the death of his gnolls and had left one of his scimitars to frame the drow. While tracking Ulgulu back to his lair, Drizzt anticipated that Tephanis was shadowing him and managed to capture him after the quickling impacted a plowshare the drow had dragged from the farm. He briefly interrogated the quickling before casting him over the cliff when Tephanis tried to free himself. Soon, Drizzt came face-to-face with Ulgulu and his brother   and killed both barghests with Guenhywvar's help. Afterwards, he was followed by the   named Lagerbottoms, who wanted to ally with him but Drizzt killed him to prevent the giant from killing innocents. \n Drizzt was soon forced to flee Maldobar as McGristle teamed up with  's party to hunt him down, though Dove was less than convinced of Drizzt's guilt. One night, Drizzt approached the party's camp and was caught by  , whose bias against drow made Drizzt's attempts to profess his innocence impossible, forcing him to flee. Eventually, Drizzt led his pursuers in the path of a band of   but decide to double back to help them, convincing Dove of his innocence, after which she forced McGristle to return to Maldobar while Kellindil maintained watch on Drizzt. \n Drizzt later came to  , where he spent the winter in the cave of   the bear. His presence was noticed by the orc king,  , who began to fear the drow as a potential rival. Drizzt was saved from the orcs by  , who took him under his protection and teaching him the ways of the   as well as helping him understand he had been following the ways of the goddess   his whole life. After Montolio passed away, Drizzt became a wanderer on the surface trying to find a place to accept him despite his heritage. \n After six years of wandering, Drizzt was came to   after parting company with the  . Though Speaker   denied him entry into  , he was directed up   to build his reputation in protecting  . He was later pursued by  , but Drizzt couldn't bring himself to kill his pursuer. Drizzt gained the trust of Catti-brie and   who chased McGristle away.  Drizzt later became good friends with the halfling   as well as Bruenor. In the final year of the servitude   owed Bruenor, Drizzt became his teacher at fighting and the two became good friends. They even ended up saving Icewind Dale from   and   as well as the demon  . \n During the reclamation of  , Drizzt became openly accepted in Icewind Dale and Luskan, resulting in Drizzt being accepted in  , though the riders of   remained openly prejudiced against him. He also made an enemy of Artemis Entreri. He chased Entreri down to   to rescue Regis, but the fight was interrupted by the people of Calimport. \n Shortly after   was retaken for  , in the winter of the  , Lady   invited Drizzt to visit Silverymoon as her guest, and he accepted. On the way, he encountered a band of farmers from   hunting   and   raiders who'd taken people from their village, and they joined forces. Drizzt tracked down the raiders and slew the ogres, saving the prisoners. However,   demanded the return of a   named  , one of the prisoners, claiming he'd led a previous raid and was being held for trial. Drizzt recaptured Nojheim and returned him to Rico, only to discover that he was in fact Rico's  . Drizzt spoke with Nojheim and found him to be highly intelligent and good-hearted, and felt they had similar plights. Nojheim taught Drizzt much about how others viewed him\u2014exotic and beautiful as much as he was dangerous, while the goblin had no such aid\u2014and Drizzt in turn vowed to free him. He immediately rode to Silverymoon to petition Alustriel to free the goblin but she was away on business. He returned to Pengallen but found Nojheim hanged at the village gate. Rico had heard their conversation and executed him, but no one would openly refute his claim that Nojheim attacked him. Drizzt wanted to confront Rico for his crime but was discouraged by  ; he could do nothing legally. Drizzt reflected that Nojheim had deeply affected his worldview, and vowed that in the future he would deal with such slavery first and the consequences after. \n Later, Drizzt was kidnapped by his sister, Vierna, whose actions would result in the death of Wulfgar and other casualties, all in a mad attempt to regain Lolth's favor. Drizzt was then forced to deal with Entreri again, who had kidnapped Regis. When Drizzt and Artemis finally got a fair fight, Regis was the factor that resulted in Drizzt's victory. \n After killing Vierna,  Drizzt left for Menzoberranzan to learn more of  's plans. Although Baenre tortured Drizzt, he escaped, albeit with the help of Catti-brie and Entreri.  When the inevitable war between Menzoberranzan and Mithral Hall took place, Drizzt played a major role,  only to leave with Catti-brie to sail with Captain  . \n The two had many adventures with Deudermont, bringing them into contact with such items as the  . The two eventually left the fight against piracy when Drizzt was forced to cause the return of Errtu, who implied Lolth gifted him someone close to him; Drizzt initially believed it to be Zaknafein before later discovering it was Wulfgar. After once again defeating Errtu,  Drizzt was then faced with the horror of Jarlaxle taking possession of the Crystal Shard. Although Drizzt allowed Jarlaxle to keep the Shard, he was faced with one more fight against Entreri, one which the assassin would end up winning through the help of  , though Jarlaxle helped fake Drizzt's demise. \n In the  , Drizzt was involved in the battle at   against the invading   and  . He distracted five of the nine giants, leading them on a chase that led to him entering a cave system through a narrow gap. The giants were unable to follow him inside, and blocked off the entrance with boulders. Drizzt spent several days looking for an alternative way out, and when he found one, he returned near to Shallows to witness the collapse of its wizard's tower, with a figure he thought to be Bruenor on it. He believe that Bruenor had been killed, and this had a profound emotional effect on him. \n Drizzt and Guen battling a frost giant. Although the Companions of the Hall soon reunited, it would be in vain as Drizzt experienced the horror of accidentally killing Ellifain. Drizzt's torments grew even worse as he believed Catti-brie, Regis, Wulfgar and Bruenor were all dead by the actions of  . During this time, Drizzt worked with   and plotted to kill Obould. Drizzt fought two duels with Obould, one in which he was defeated and one that resulted in a draw. \n Drizzt later returned to Mithral Hall, with the Companions of the Hall alive and well. He then acted on his feelings with Catti-brie, who had never resumed her relationship with Wulfgar, and Drizzt eventually married her. During the time Drizzt was in a relationship with Catti-brie, he dealt with an uprising in the  ,   the Pirate King, and the  . \n The   resulted in the deaths of Catti-brie and Regis, leaving Drizzt and Bruenor to find   alone. During their search for clues, Drizzt became involved in another war with Many-Arrows, engaging in the fighting and diplomatic efforts before being rewarded by the government of   and fostering a better relationship with the orcs. \n After a fifty-year search, Drizzt and Bruenor eventually found Gauntlygrym. However, it lay near the \"city\" of  , which was a core target of the war between   and  , another war Drizzt would be drawn into. \n With Bruenor dying in the battle for Gauntlgrym, Drizzt joined forces with  , with whom he engaged in a romantic relationship. He later ran into Artemis Entreri again, whose life had apparently been sustained by  . Drizzt joined forces with his long-time nemesis, dealing blows to both Thay and the   by orchestrating the killings of   for Dahlia and   for Entreri's freedom. However, while battling Alegni in Neverwinter, Guenhwyvar leapt through a portal to the   and Drizzt found that he could no longer summon her. \n Drizzt then destroyed Charon's Claw, as per Entreri's wish for death. When this did not kill his rival, the drow and Dahlia were joined by the assassin, now as an ally. Also joining them were two former   mercenaries, a dwarven spy for   named   and a monk who used to be part of the   named  . \n Drizzt briefly sought out   when he learned that the   had risen as a   but left him to face the sun as per Pwent's wish. He did however discover that he could summon Guenhwyvar again, though she appeared haggard, as if she had not rested. Focusing instead on a plan to change Entreri's moral outlook and distract Dahlia from her unexpected reunion with her son (whom she had thought dead for twenty years), he led his four allies to   and helped restore that city to a measure of its former glory. Traveling to Luskan,   persuaded Drizzt and his friends to travel by boat to   but it was all a ploy by   to get them out of Luskan as   was coming to hunt and defeat Drizzt in combat. \n While in Baldur's Gate, Artemis cuckolded him with Dahlia and they encountered Dahlia's son   again. They took Effron with them on their ship, where he and his mother reconciled. Effron became an ally and told Drizzt that Guenhwyvar was imprisoned on the Shadowfell by   and was using Drizzt's oldest friend to spy on the group. Effron brought them to the Shadowfell and helped them to invade Quick's manse. It was a trap though and Drizzt was captured with Effron, while the others were petrified by a  . Drizzt was a prisoner of Quick for nearly a year, repeatedly grilled on his faith in Mielikki until a rescue was mounted by Jarlaxle, who freed him and all of his friends. However, back in Luskan, they were warned that Tiago was still hunting them. Drizzt resolved to go back to Icewind Dale to keep his friends safe. \n While there, he heard rumors of   and when he and his friends arrived there, powerful magic sent them all to sleep. They were trapped in that pocket plane for, as it turned out, eighteen years, finally awakening in the  , a coincidence not lost on the group. \n A lot had changed in those years. Drizzt was no longer welcome in the   after Errtu had returned to take his revenge and Drizzt wasn't around to defend against the  . Drizzt's allies reasoned that they could leave Icewind Dale safely but Drizzt refused to leave with them, explaining to Dahlia that he no longer held any affection for her, deciding they should go their separate ways. Soon after that admission, the outraged Dahlia attacked and mortally wounded him, as he didn't want to harm her. She left with Entreri, Ambergris, Afafrenfere, and Effron. Drizzt was left behind, though the monk and the dwarf wanted to go back and aid him. \n With the help of Guenhwyvar, he managed to climb atop Kelvin's Cairn. His head wound was mortal and it was obvious that he was going to die. The drow even saw light and the image of  , whom he thought had come as a ghost to him. As he lay dying from his wound, however, a Catti-brie of flesh and blood arrived, accompanied by  ,   and, most shockingly,  . All of them had been reincarnated by Mielikki, the goddess giving them a second chance in life to aid Drizzt Do'Urden. Catti-brie healed Drizzt by the grace of   and they were all reunited. \n But their adventures were far from over as the     was onto them, following Regis from the  . \n The Companions, reunited, traveled to Gauntlgrym to release   from his curse of  . Along the way, they stopped in  , where the   gave Catti-brie items to entrap Pwent's soul. However, Catti-brie instead used the items to entrap the    's soul, forcing her to later capture Pwent in Wulfgar's horn of summoning. In Gauntlgrym, the Companions learned about the entrapment of Artemis Entreri,  ,  , and  , formerly Drizzt's companions. Drizzt insisted they remain to aid them. The first two escaped, but Dahlia was apparently killed in the battle between the proxy of   (Dahlia) versus the proxy of Mielikki (Catti-brie). \n The Companions then headed back to Longsaddle, where the Harpells released Pwent, although his embodiment remained in the horn of summoning. They headed out for Mithral Hall, but stopped in   to take a stand against   and   attacks involved with the  . Drizzt engaged in some subterfuge with Regis, who used his hat to disguise himself as a goblin shaman. The Companions left after a time; soon after, Nesme fell to the horde. \n The Companions travelled through the Underdark to reach Mithral Hall, although Wulfgar and Regis became separated from the group, when they encountered   and   who lurked in the tunnels below the fortress. After escaping these enemies, Drizzt, Bruenor, and Catti-brie made their way to the throne room of Mithral Hall, where they revealed the truth of the companions' reincarnations to  . Although Connerad offered to give up the throne to Bruenor, the dwarf declined. \n Later, Drizzt, Bruenor, and Catti-brie led an attempt to break out of the besieged Mithral Hall, which was foiled by   and  , with Drizzt only surviving his encounter with the dragon (and its dangerous ice breath) because of the spell of cold resistance Catti-brie cast on him. \n Drizzt was haunted by the memory of a   girl called  , also known by her male alias \"Le'lorinel\". On his first visit to the surface, he participated in an attack on the surface elves with his fellow drow. During this experience, he began to realize how vile he found his own kin, and saved the young Ellifain by smearing her with blood from her mother's corpse. Ellifain recalled a different account of events and believed Drizzt to be responsible for her mother's death, hunting him down relentlessly. \n This culminated in a final encounter between the two, in which both were mortally wounded. Ellifain died believing Drizzt to have also been killed, but   came to his aid and saved his life. \n Drizzt finally released his guilt after Ellifain's soul was summoned and apologized for her unwarranted hatred of Drizzt. \n Drizzt found himself in love with Catti-brie, although he was unwilling to deal with the emotional implications of this initially.  Her eventual death heralded a significant change in Drizzt's personality. \n Drizzt sometimes used nicknames with Catti-brie, calling her \"Cat\"  or \"Catti.\"  In  , Drizzt gave Catti-brie the magical ruby band (found on  's body) as a symbol of his love. \n Catti-brie gave birth to their daughter  \u2014named for both of her grandfathers, Bruenor and Zaknafein\u2014during the war between all the houses of Menzoberranzan outside and beneath Gauntlgrym in 1488 DR. The child had auburn hair, like her mother, and her eye color was like her father's, except a deeper, jewel-toned purple. Brie-Zara's skin tone was somewhere between her parents' coloring, like a pink flower at dusk in hue. \n  was the arch-nemesis of Drizzt Do'Urden. Despite his human nature, Entreri was one of the few matches for Drizzt in combat. Drizzt believed Entreri to be his alter-ego, and the person he became when he took on the mindset of the Hunter.  He also saw similarities between Entreri and his beloved father,  \u2014both killed only those they believed deserved it, were the best at their craft, and fought against a world they perceived as evil. However, he believed that Entreri was unjustified in his actions, and that there were some aspects of his reality that were deserving of mercy. He also saw a glint of compassion hidden under the \"impenetrable shell that he [Entreri] now wears.\" For this reason, Drizzt spared Entreri when he managed to best him in combat. Drizzt hoped that Entreri would find a way out of the emotionless, empty existence he lived.  When they were reunited many years later, after Drizzt thought the man long dead, he tried to foster that spark of compassion once   was thrown into  's pit and seemed to have made some progress during their adventures in Port Llast. Ultimately, Entreri saved Drizzt from Dahlia's brutal attack on  . \n  was a conundrum for Drizzt. Plagued by memories of Catti-brie, he struggled to reconcile his desires for the passionate, attractive elf. He came to realize, after nearly a year with her, that he was using her to try and get over his late wife as much as she was using him for his body. Things were further complicated when he discovered that Dahlia and Artemis Entreri had bonded on an emotional level, linked by their troubled lives. Though Charon's Claw tried to fan the flames of resentment to prevent its destruction, eventually he found that he didn't care, even ignoring the fact that Dahlia slept with the assassin. Unfortunately, Dahlia had fallen in love with Drizzt and greatly resented his repeated rejection of her, which led to her attacking him with lethal force. \n Since his debut in 1988, Drizzt Do'Urden has been illustrated by many different authors. Since 2004 and the reissue of many of R.A. Salvatore's books under the   series, much of the artwork of the drow has been done by  .\n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drizzt_Do%27Urden"},

The helmet itself had three stages, each of which would increase its power considerably. Its full potential could only be awakened by a high priestess of Lolth. \n The   was created in   long before the mid\u201314  century  . It was created by a high   of unknown name and House. The priestess hoped to use the power of the legendary helmet to unite the   under her House and lead assaults on both the   and the surface world. The goddess Lolth, being a chaotic deity, despised such terrible ambition under the pretext of unity. Thus, she ordered the destruction of the creator, and the creator's House. The Queen of Spiders also erased the memory of those who were aware of the helm's existence. \n Under orders of their goddess, the drow engaged in a raging battle with the unknown House, which was crushed. As a result, the mysterious helmet was split into its three components, and lost in time. \n Aeons later, parts of the artifact were recovered. The base of the helmet was recovered by an innkeeper from  .  , upon finding out about this discovery, instructed the innkeeper to transport it to Menzoberranzan. He, however, had different ideas, and passed the item to a group of adventurers, heading to Menzoberranzan to rescue prisoners of their village. The group believed it to be an ordinary magical helmet, a gift to them from the innkeeper, for their efforts in fighting off a drow raid. \n The adventuring group then, before heading into the Underdark, sought out a wise     called  . He informed them that a trade caravan carrying gems had mysteriously gone missing to the east. The party found four of these rare gems in a cavern of  . The   then enchanted the gems to allow the party to see in the  . Unbeknown to the party and the druid, one of these gems was actually the Gem of Lolth. \n After they made their way to the   caverns, the party were able to find the crest of the Helm, in the form of a spider carved of jade. \n When the party finally reached Menzoberranzan, still unaware of the properties of the helmet, they entered the   to trade.  , a well-known drow merchant, offered the party a mystical healing  , and a pair of magic candles. In need of healing after their strenuous journey, the party accepted the trade. \n The group of adventurers later found a merchant, called  , who specialized in the trade of information. Desperate to find the captive villagers, the party promised to free the soul of her beloved   from the  's curse, kept in the throne of Matron Baenre. Ssar Tarell sent them to  , who had further information and a scroll to allow them to both access House Baenre and to undo the drider curse. \n Upon arrival at the throne of Matron Baenre, the curse was undone, and the party witnessed a meeting that took place between the innkeeper (from their village in Icewind Dale) and the matron mother. She reprimanded the innkeeper for not transporting it to her himself, and was about to execute the man. He, however, noticed the party he had given the helm to, and told Matron Baenre. The party informed the matron mother that they traded it already, and she angrily demanded for them to retrieve it, or they would be slain. \n The party returned to Galentha, who they found struck by an assassin. The assassin then levitated to  . The adventurers returned to Ssar Tarell, who was joined by her love, now freed of the drider's curse. He told the party that House Do'Urden, not only had the helmet, but was also keeping the prisoners of the adventurers' village. \n For the final part of her information, Galentha told the companions to seek out the   wizard,  , who largely opposed House Do'Urden. He told the party to seek out Rizzen Do'Urden, a spy who secretly worked for House Fey-Branche. Before they left, the wizard transformed each of the party members into drow elves, to disguise them as a returning patrol. He also gave them the code word,  , to let Rizzen know who had sent them. \n For the final time, the adventurers stopped by Ssar Tarell to gain information on the gem that Grumsnzar had mentioned. She opened up a   between the party and Vermulean, who identified one of the gems the party carried as the Gem of Lolth, the final part of the  . \n After they found Rizzen Do'Urden in  , he provided them with a map of House Do'Urden, and a passphrase to get by the house guards. He told them that the final missing piece was a House Do'Urden insignia, and the mercenary   could help them. \n In exchange for a house insignia, the mercenary made an offer to the party. He asked them to retrieve a rare   necklace from the   caverns, a dangerous cavern filled with   and  . Upon returning the necklace, Jarlaxle somewhat met his promise, not giving them the insignia, but telling them where it could be found. \n From Jarlaxle's directions, the party came across a patrol full of young Do'Urden nobles. The companions slew the group, picked up their insignia, and assumed their identities. \n The adventurers from the surface were now equipped to enter House Do'Urden. After getting past the house guards, the party made its way to the nobles' area. The party searched the upper part of the house extensively, and finally found the helmet with the crest attached. The companions attached the gem to the helm and crest, forming the full  . \n Upon acquisition of the full helm, the party was ambushed by Rizzen Do'Urden, who had used the party as his pawns all along. Along with a high priestess and a group of drow  , they challenged the adventurers. However, with the full   at their disposal, the adventurers' beat down Rizzen's force. \n Eager to free the captives, the party of adventurers entered  's sacrificial chamber. Malice angrily stopped the ritual and sent her   to defeat the party. Again, with the unique artifact, the adventurers slew the handmaiden of Lolth, and retrieved the prison key. \n Before they moved on, it was clear that a rival house was invading House Do'Urden, and the party sought to escape. Here, they were confronted by high priestesses of House Fey-Branche, who congratulated them on opening the way to the destruction of House Do'Urden. The adventurers killed the priestesses, and met up with  . The renegade drow elf lead the party to the prison where the captives were held, and the villagers were freed.

The path through   was the quickest journey between Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad, but it was less traveled because of the danger that lurked there. \n Menzoberranzan was located in a huge arrowhead-shaped cavern, some two miles wide and a thousand feet high. The drow called the cavern,  .  The city was mainly carved from calcite and it was filled with blue, green, and violet faerie fire. Buildings were often covered with the city's main motif: the spider, in honor of Lolth.  The roof of Menzoberranzan was covered in paths. Some homes were 1,000 feet above the floor. Ceiling houses had to have great magic to prevent them from falling, and many were empty.  An enchantment in the city cavern reduced echos from all the noise. \n There were a fixed number of buildings in Menzoberrazan, meaning that the poorer areas were extremely crowded.  Noble houses, once destroyed or abandoned, were not permitted to be reoccupied, meaning that there were a number of abandoned compounds both on the surface and roof of the city cavern. \n Narbondel and  , the Archmage of Menzoberranzan The city had around a hundred gates, all guarded. These gates led into the myriad tunnels surrounding the city (collectively called the  ). \n One of the most distinct structures in the city was the pillar-clock called  . It was enchanted each morning by the   with a glow that slowly dissipated as the day wore on. Narbondel could be seen from throughout the entire city. When the pillar was completely dark, it was called   (effectively midnight). \n  the Kinless, a powerful priestess of Lolth, founded the city that bears her name in  .  By the wishes of Lady Lolth, she led seven drow families into the   from the city of  , one of the southerly drow holdings of  .  Their goal was to escape from the constant warring between factions who venerated Lolth and those that worshiped  .  Lolth aided them on their journey directly via dream-sendings, but only when it seemed like all hope was lost. After battling several of the Underdark's natives, including a conflict with a clan of   to whom they lost half their number, they slew a   in   that claimed a huge natural cave as its lair. The surviving drow took up residence in this cave, naming it after their leader. \n The original seven drow families, having no immediate external enemy, fell to attacking and undermining one another\u2014\u2014exactly what they had hoped to escape\u2014to the greater glory of their evil goddess, who loved chaos. Only fifty years after the city's founding, in  , a great and terrible battle between the two most powerful Houses,   and  , occurred. This battle led to the collapse of a cavern wall that destroyed four houses and killed Menzoberra. The perpetrators, House Nasadra, were attacked by   and House Baenre chose to side with them against Nasadra. House Nasadra were banished from the cave on the orders of Lolth, who ordered them to establish a second city in her name (which would come, a few decades later, to be called  , and House Nasadra was still the First House there until the city's destruction) and for the two cities to maintain an amicable relationship.   then rose as the First House of Menzoberranzan. \n In the 13th and 14th centuries DR, this pattern seemed to have accelerated.   ascended from the Tenth House to the Ninth House by destroying the Fourth House,   in  . However   took in the last DeVir survivor, an act which prompted a cold war between the two houses lasting decades. Finally in   House Hun'ett attacked House Do'Urden with the latter narrowly winning due to the much-needed aid of  's mercenary band  . \n House Do'Urden lost the favor of Lolth due to the rebellion of  , for the last time, when Matron   failed to kill Drizzt with   after transforming him into a  . This resulted in House Baenre utterly destroying House Do'Urden in the  . \n In  , during the  ,  , the Third House, aspired to become the First House of Menzoberranzan. Menzoberranzan was caught in a  , so magic did not work there. House Oblodra, however, was gifted in the rare art of   and seized upon this opportunity to strike at the other Houses. The matron of House Oblodra nearly reached her goal, but an avatar of Lolth answered Matron Baenre's pleas for help and came to Menzoberranzan after the Time of Troubles had ended. Although she loved chaos, she did not wish to see a House that did not whisper prayer to her to rule the city. Foreseeing her temporary loss of power due to the Time of Troubles, Lolth had asked the demon   to protect her worshipers, should she herself fail to do it. She opened a portal for Errtu and his host of demons to lay siege to House Oblodra. \n By the time the Time of Troubles had passed, Lolth was restored to full power and single-handedly crushed House Oblodra, the remains of their stronghold being pushed into a deep chasm known as the  , and Matron Oblodra's spirit went to Errtu for eternal torment. Thus the ranks of the ruling Houses changed once again. All this she said was done for her greatest high priestess (although it was really done for herself), the two thousand-year-old Matron  . All Houses in the city witnessed this great miracle and knew that House Baenre was the most favored House of the goddess. \n In celebration, the city marched upon   in  , viciously attacking the dwarfhold in what would be known as the  . The drow lost the battle and the retreat was sounded after Matron Baenre herself was felled by  's axe.  It was estimated that half of the city's 20,000 drow marched on Mithral Hall, but an unknown number returned, although some estimates said that 2,000 drow were killed and 4,000 slaves were lost.  In addition, many of the city's slaves had been used as fodder, leading to a dearth of agriculture. Upon the army's return, the city had been badly weakened and its leadership was in chaos. \n Yvonnel's eldest daughter Triel took her mother's place as leader of the city but faced many hardships during her time in power. Despite an early victory against   in  , the constant infighting between the noble houses resulted in a rapid depopulation of the drow citizens of the city. Lolth herself expressed her displeasure and imposed a forced   in   among the city's populace until Menzoberranzan's numbers had been restored. \n In the  , not long after the peace was lifted, the   began when Lolth stopped answering her priestesses' calls and granting them spells. A number of disillusioned drow males,  , and slaves banded together under the rule of the     in an attempt to weaken and take over the city. However, the plot was unraveled by   and  , who had been investigating the missing males, but not before the slave revolt began on   and great damage was done to the city due to   flasks and slain slaves.  The masters of   were able to cast a ritual spell to summon lightning and rain that ended the revolt. \n Almost immediately thereafter, a   army led by King   of   and helped by   of the   marched to attack the city. The most powerful houses mustered the   to meet the opposing army at the  , where the duergar were joined by the traitorous contingent of   and the   of  . The Army of the Black Spider was soundly defeated and forced to escape back to the city.  Menzoberranzan was then besieged by the invading army on   15,  .  The   was costly but when the Silence of Lolth ended several months later, Menzoberranzan's defenders turned the tide of the battle and drew victory from defeat. The   left the city on   30,  . \n Menzoberranzan returned to form quickly.   killed her older sister Triel, taking her place as leader of House Baenre. \n From the year  ,  , under the influence of her mother  's memories, brought demons into the city to distract the lesser houses from plotting against  .  In the chaos, drow battled demons to survive in the city streets, while the gates of each noble house closed their doors to the outside to protect themselves. \n From the year  ,  Lolth manipulated the Menzoberranzan archmage Gromph Baenre into inadvertently summoning her rival  , the Prince of Demons, into the city.  On its arrival, Demogorgon destroyed the ceiling of the archmage's chambers at Sorcere  then left Sorcere and killed and ate many drow,  while others were left maddened in its path of devastation through the city.  Demogorgon dug a large trench halfway across the city and into the Underdark wilderness.  The protective planar barrier for the   was deemed damaged or broken by the summoning ritual.  The combined powers of the city's wizards' spells and other attacks such as arrows  were channeled into a   created by an   hive mind onto  .  Drizzt leaped onto and struck Demogorgon's chest, releasing the immense collective power generated by the drow city that destroyed demon prince. \n An open civil war was triggered after   and Quenthel Baenre reversed the curse of abomination on eight hundred   who'd been gifted to   by Lolth's handmaidens.  For the drow, it was considered impossible and a blasphemy to cure the driders without the will of Lolth aiding the ritual.  Quenthel Baenre invited the former driders to join House Baenre, which was also seen as a blasphemous act.  She also declared the laws of Lolth a lie to the ruling council. \n The war was fought between Houses loyal to Lolth and those who remained allied to House Baenre. The following is a breakdown of the factions involved during the war.   was an army of resurrected drow based in House Baenre.  They were previously long-dead driders tormented in the   by Lolth.  Their leader   fell in battle against   and was betrayed by former drider  .    high priestess   offered refuge for those loyal to Lolth. She transformed into the first   of Lolth during the war.    abandoned their loyalty to House Baenre to watch the war from the shadows.

House Barrison Del'Armgo assaulted the compound in an attempt to free it from House Baenre.  House Barrison Del'Armgo sided with House Melarn, but Mez'Barris Armgo was killed in a fight with Bregan D'aerthe by the possessed  .  House Melarn's Matron   became the second avatar of Lolth during the war.  She and her house were destroyed when Gromph Baenre returned to the city  and detonated his staff, causing a large explosion  that banished Lolth and her handmaidens for a hundred years. \u00a0\n In the wars aftermath,   and   negotiated a truce where approximately 2000 heretical drow refugees  were allowed to leave the city on the condition they could not return.  Sos'Umptu also agreed to show mercy to the drow that remained.  Sos'Umptu hinted that Bregan D'aerthe could return if they found any mutual benefits for her in the future.  Sos'Umptu became the new ruling matron mother of the city. \n In  , there were approximately 20,000 drow in the city, with 1,000 of them considered nobles of the 60-70 noble houses. Slaves included  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .  According to   in  , human slaves were rare in Menzoberranzan, but not unheard of. \n In  , the city had 32,000 inhabitants \u2014 approximately one-third   and the rest humanoid slaves, namely  ,  ,  ,  , and the occasional  .  \n   , the city was back to 20,000 drow. \n As many as 1,200 visitors might have been in the city at one time, including  ,  ,  ,  , and  . \n Independent traders and merchantile companies were an important part of drow society. They were run mostly by male drow, though a few merchants, such as  , contradicted this standard. The trade was a dangerous one, even more so for non-drow, and many died quickly due to \"accidents\" from Houses that disliked them or from rival traders. Some were sponsored by noble Houses, ensuring their survival in some cases. \n The city exported poisons, mushrooms,  , spell scrolls,  , and water (clean water could be hard to come by in the Underdark).  Other goods included body dyes, chains,     from deep dragon scales,  , herbal medicines,  , musical instruments ( ,  ), obsidian carvings (often used for sacrifices), perfumes, spells, spiced  , stone sculptures, surgical services, textiles, tortoiseshell goods, and  . \n The city imported produce (surface and Underdark), shellfish, slaves, and textiles. \n The neighboring drow city of   provided fully half of Menzoberranzan's goods. \n Various currencies were accepted in Menzoberranzan. Coins came in many shapes, including round, square, triangular, ring and spider-shaped coins. The greatest dozen houses in Menzoberrzan minted the coins.  For example, House Baenre minted their own coins with the Baenre emblem, which were accepted throughout the city. \n The city had many different factions, or Houses, all of which vied for power. As it was a matriarchal society, however, only females truly held power. Officially, the city was under the rule of the Ruling Council of Eight, composed of the eight   of the first (and most powerful) eight houses.  For many centuries\u2014as long as any living drow could remember\u2014it was under the indirect rule of   which was governed by Matron Mother  , also known as Old Matron Baenre, perhaps the most powerful de facto ruler the city ever saw. House Baenre had been the First House of Menzoberrazan for centuries of uncontested power. \n Although drow culture was matriarchal, a few male drow in the city held some political power, including  , the archmage of the city, and  , leader of the mercenary band  , which was often utilized by House Baenre. \n Menzoberranzan was guarded by huge magical jade spider constructs.  The two dozen or so most powerful houses were able to muster an army, such as the   in  , to defend the city at times of need. \n The worship of   was prevalent, and the worship of any other deity was forbidden.  However, there were a number of secret (mainly male) worshipers of  . \n The   of Menzoberranzan was located in   and was composed of three schools:  , the clerical school;  , the wizards' school; and  , the warriors' school.  Tier Breche and   (see below) were considered the \"two heads\" (most important unifying parts) of Menzoberranzan. \n Local food was primarily produced in and around  . The   in the lake housed the city's   herds, managed by  , which provided rothe   and meat to the city.  The area in and around Donigarten also housed moss fields, giant mushrooms, fungus farms, fish, and orc and goblin slaves. \n , a type of aggressive fish similar to piranhas, was prized, despite being deadly if not prepared in the correct manner. \n Cheap street food in Menzoberranzan included sausage and rolls, which could be bought from street vendors in the   slum,  and pickled sausage.  Finer foods included rothe steak, raw mushrooms with creamy dipping sauces, wine, and a salad of black, red, and white fungus. \n Alcoholic beverages found in Menzoberranzan included green   wine  and a type of sweet dessert wine.  There was also   brandy  and some drow favored   brandy. \n Entertainment was perhaps not the most obvious word connected with Menzoberranzan, but the city nevertheless provided recreation and relaxation (as much as possible) to its (drow) inhabitants. Taverns were plentiful and brothels could be found if one looked hard enough.  The Bazaar offered food, shopping, street performers, and even a game tent or two.  \"Houses of delights,\" massage parlors, and public bath houses, all of which were usually manned by slaves, offered their services. \n Well-to-do drow, particularly nobles who were not busy plotting to overthrow their rivals or guarding against usurpers of their positions, were fond of wild parties and dances. \n  was a popular  -like game that represented war between noble houses. It was often played in taverns. \n Another notable past time in Menzoberranzan was the plotting and carrying out of pranks. \n Because the drow worshiped Lolth, the Spider Queen, killing spiders (even unintentionally) was punishable by death by the law of Lolth. \n By law, parties had to end at start of new day (the  , or midnight).  Dancing while armed was considered an insult (as well as being hazardous),  so dances, particularly the frenzied  , were usually performed sans clothing. \n Death (usually by intrigue) was widespread in Menzoberranzan. The dead were usually placed in airtight stone crypts in the solid rock north of the city cavern so that they could later be reanimated as battle fodder. Only priestesses were cremated to prevent such a thing occurring to their corpses. \n \"Rock, knife, and parchment\" was game in Menzoberranzan after the manner of \"rock, paper, scissors.\" \n Map of the city's districts. Sick and outlaw drow lived here, along with the many non-drow inhabitants of the city. This was definitely the slum of Menzoberranzan. \n Most commoners, including mercenaries and lesser merchants, lived in this neighborhood.  While better than the Braeryn, Eastmyr was still where you would find many poor and outlaw drow and non-drow of no discernible means. Despite the lack of wealthy residents,   and   were based here. \n Home of the well-off commoners of the city, as well as wealthy non-drow.  Tradesfolk and their shops/businesses were mostly found here. Most Menzoberranyr came from this area and it was the most varied and tolerant district in the entire city.  It was located near Tier Breche.    was located here. \n This was the home of the wealthy and up-and-coming drow houses. No fewer than seven existing powerful noble houses and several of the most luxurious and profitable of businesses were located in this neighborhood. The best gems and perfumes could be found here, as well as the city's moneylenders.  Narbondellyn was stretched out in front of Qu'ellarz'orl. \n The West Wall was covered in the fortresses of more minor noble houses and the proudest of the non-noble drow families.   provided attractive drow of either sex to escort those who desired them or to act as tour guides to visitors.  Menzoberranzan's embassy with Ched Nasad was located in the West Wall. \n This plateau was located in the southwestern corner of the city and was screened from the rest of the city by a forest of giant mushrooms.  Contrary to the rest of the city, Qu'ellarz'orl was spacious and bare, no crowds were found here, nor any businesses. The space that was occupied was dominated by the most powerful noble houses:  ,   ,   ,  and  .  \n The location of the three academies of Menzoberranzan:  ,   and  . It was the highest point in the city and was protected by two giant spider statues that could be animated to protect the academy.  It was located in a side cavern on the northern side of the city. \n The area around   in the eastern side of the cavern was nearly uninhabited but was the source of all of Menzoberranzan's food.  \n A rocky outcropping shaped like a claw on the end of a long arm situated between the Bazaar and Eastmyr. The ancient tunnels and walkways dug into the rock were used by   to house their hundreds of   slaves, but was later infested by  .    maintained a base here. \n A permanent market located in Duthcloim. Nearly anything could be bought here, for a price. It was also the location of many unlicensed and illicit activities.  Traders in the Bazaar had to shift locations every 66 days. \n The council chambers were located in a small cavern off of the main city cavern and were where the Ruling Council met to discuss important matters. In the council chambers was the Hall of Petition. Outside that was a waiting room. Only those commanded to come were able to come. The floor was made of black marble and on the walls were friezes of Menzoberranzan's founding. \n This freshwater lake in the eastern side of the cavern was the source of much food in the city. A small amount of fishing was done in Lake Donigarten and, on an islet in the middle of said lake, the city's supply of   were kept, looked after by   and  .    tended the   herds on the   that fed the city. \n A few twisted passages and side caverns accessible from the main cavern could be found in the Mantle,  actually part of the   but close enough to the city proper for residents to build homes. \n Several non-House organizations operated in Menzoberranzan, including\n All of the tunnels within an 8km (5 mile) radius of the city were known as the Dark Dominion; the nearest ones leading to the city were known as the   (meaning \"around cloak\")  Drow patrols were a constant presence of the region.  They searched for banned creatures, monsters and surface elves and challenged them once spotted. A few guard outposts could also be found in these tunnels. At least ten of the tunnels that started here led to the surface. One that led straight past   and into   and one that led to the   were the two most commonly used.  The Dark Dominion was full of dangerous magical radiation known as  .   The   and   were caverns southeast of Menzoberranzan. \n About six days' travel on foot from Menzoberranzan was a large  -free cavern. Most people who wanted to teleport to the city aimed for this cave and a few keyed two-way portals could be found here,  along with a waterfall that provided free fresh water.

They were carnivorous humanoids, known for their savage culture and warlike ways. \n Gnolls were extremely tall, with the average member of the race standing on average between 7\u20320\u2033\u20127\u20326\u2033 (2.1\u20122.3\u202fm). Though gnolls were relatively lean for their height, weighing in usually between 280-320lb (127-145kg) , they cut an impressive visage. In part because of their height and lean musculature, gnolls were very quick compared with many other races such as  .  Gnoll skin was greenish-gray, and their furry hide a light or dark brown hue, sometimes marked with spots or stripes. Many gnolls also had a dirty yellow to a reddish-gray crest-like mane that stood on end when they were angry. \n It is believed by some that gnolls had traces of   blood, which may be evidenced by unusual features found among some of the gnoll bloodlines. These may have included talons, gleaming red eyes, or black fur with fiery orange spots. \n Female gnolls were indistinguishable from males by size, in spite of a reputation for being shorter. In fact, so similar were male and female gnolls in appearance that they were often mistaken for one another. The only reliable way to tell the difference, other than through a close physical examination, was if a female was pregnant or openly nursing. \n Gnolls had very short lifespans when compared with other sapient humanoids, living only 30 or so years on average and maturing to adulthood at a remarkable speed. Gnolls did not, however, age particularly dramatically except at the end of their lifespans, at which point the decline quickly ended in their death.  When a gnoll died, its bones were occasionally harvested by the other gnolls and animated by rituals into a  , a type of skeletal gnoll. \n More so than many other humanoid races, primal instinct was a strong part of the gnoll psyche. Gnolls were natural predators and savored the thrills of the hunt. Almost all gnolls preferred the wilderness to the civilized enclaves favored by humans,  , or other similar races and those that do take to cities have usually thought of them as just another kind of landscape. \n Many other races  found the gnoll psyche feral and aggressive, male and female equally,  and the behavioral tendencies of the race certainly gave this impression. Gnolls started fighting among one another at a very early age and many, as soon as they could walk, crawled into places away from the eyes of adults where they engaged in vicious, often lethal battles.  A gnoll was more likely to demand answers than to ask a question. Gnolls, however, did not see this as an act of hostility, but a basic demonstration of strength. \n Though gnolls were not necessarily evil, the craving for the hunt and primal bloodlust that inhabited the gnoll's mind made many of the race lean towards a   alignment by reflex. Gnolls that succumbed to this tendency often became nomadic savages, wreaking havoc wherever they could, giving them their fearsome reputation as slaving brigands throughout the world. Fortunately, such creatures were rarely seen united and, although gnolls as a whole have had a strong affinity for family and blood ties, this friendliness was not often extended to those who belonged to a different pack; the race has commonly made war on itself.  Some gnolls could suffer from a rare form of madness that could quell their intense hunger and evil instincts, causing guilt for their misdeeds and a pacifistic nature.  \n Other gnoll practices might have seemed equally strange, such as the gnoll propensity for scavenging. At its most basic level, this tendency led many gnolls to collect trophies that remind them of past victories, items sometimes grisly though just as often simple and mundane.  Gnoll trackers have used this to their benefit, keeping scraps of clothing or other objects with the scent of their prey on them, which they have used to point them in the direction of their quarry. \n This tendency led to the even more alien gnoll practice of carrion-eating. Unlike most races, gnolls had few, if any, qualms about eating the dead of other races. When gnolls struck a village, they did not only leave no survivors but no  , eating most of those whom they did not take as slaves. There were even indications that some gnolls took this practice a step further, raiding graveyards for fresh corpses on which to feed. \n Gnolls were often known to fight with  ,  ,  , various types of  , and  . \n Gnolls were generally known to live in warm plains,  though they were highly adaptable and could be found living in most regions, sometimes even underground. They were less common in arid and arctic regions. \n In spite of the savage nature of the gnolls, there were some aspects of their culture that were not inherently repulsive. Gnolls placed a very strong value on the family, for instance, respecting blood ties perhaps more than any other aspect of a relationship. Though gnolls within a pack commonly fought with each other for dominance, these battles were quickly forgotten after their resolution, and in most situations, gnolls of the same bloodline were loyal friends and allies to one another.  These bloodlines were almost always traced maternally, through the female line. \n This loyalty to family was particularly obvious during combat, either with rival gnoll packs or other races. Gnolls who fought side by side regularly threw away personal glory in order to help their brethren. Perhaps most surprisingly, when a gnoll has been separated from clan and family their instinctive need for such blood ties has led them to form a surrogate \"pack\" from those whom they choose to befriend. To these unlikely allies, the gnoll has been as loyal and faithful as they would their own brothers or sisters, embracing the outsiders as if they were family. \n Some gnoll societies were patriarchal and led by a chieftain, the biggest and strongest of the tribe. Chieftains were known to keep harems and as gnolls bred for fieriness, the harem-wives were the strongest fighters among other males and females, second in war-strength only to the chieftain. \n The scavenging of wild gnolls rose to entirely new levels as well. While all gnolls had an innate tendency for collecting souvenirs and trophies, nomadic packs, particularly the savage ones who have had little contact with other races except during wartime, have found few other ways to acquire technology, having crafted few tools of their own. The result of this is that most gnolls relied on the other races as their source of wealth and technology. This extends to arms and weaponry, giving gnoll armor a unique aesthetic where each suit is typically made kitbashed together from scavenged pieces of armor found either on victims or abandoned. \n Gnolls of all kinds have found an affinity for hyenas, whom many see as their brethren and whom they have kept as pets or for hunting.  Besides hyenas, they were known to keep   as pets. \n Though gnolls of all kinds had a strong loyalty towards family, they have not extended such courtesies to those outside their pack, and mainstream gnoll culture has had a much-deserved reputation for brutality. Most gnolls were nomadic, wandering from land to land and living off of raids on the local populations. Victims of these attacks can expect no mercy from their attackers and those who are not killed would be taken as slaves to be brutalized and abused both physically and mentally. Gnolls have detested physical labor  and so to ensure utter loyalty from slaves have taken their brutalization and maltreatment to an art form. For this purpose, most packs have specialized slavers known as   or \"spirit breakers\" who have made it their business to break the will of a slave through repetitive torture. \n The process wreaked on a slave's mind by the   was brutal and often irrevocable. Those captives who would not submit were eaten, often in front of other slaves as yet another form of torment. Slaves who would accept their fate often lived short and brutal lives, which were ended by them being devoured. Few victims were lucky enough to be rescued and those that were may take months to shake the scars from their psyche and recover. \n An even less fortunate few find their minds so broken that they have actually embraced the brutality of their captors, becoming the   or \"savage souls,\" who have followed their masters into battle as thralls. Most of these individuals were broken creatures, little more conscious than the hyenas that the gnolls favored as pets, but a handful retained their intellect, effectively becoming gnolls in all but form. These   were the most dangerous since they, unlike regular gnolls, have been able to act as infiltrators, performing sabotage and laying the ground for gnoll raids, too often undetected until it was already too late. \n Though most gnoll packs embraced their reputation for savagery, others refrained from such utter depravity. These clans were also nomadic but unlike the others rarely engaged in violent raids except when seriously provoked. Likewise, though they retained the natural gnoll bloodlust they took no joy in torture or unnecessary cruelty, embracing hunting and tracking over outright slaughter. \n In some cases, these gnolls might have even come to befriend or at least peacefully interact with the members of other races, offering their services as trappers or hunters.  These races could often include  ,  ,  ,  , and even  .  However, they generally preferred their own kind and except when on business rarely visited neighboring villages dominated by members of another race. Likewise, these gnolls remain aggressive and quick to anger, meaning visitors should be careful not to offend. \n Gnolls were most often worshipers of the    , who some claim created them. Though some paid only nominal reverence, many gnolls were fanatically devoted to their dark overlord, his influence having been the primary cause of their savagery. Some gnolls believed it was their purpose as Yeenoghu's servants to cleanse the weak from the world, serving a higher purpose through the slaughter they had spread.  \n In spite of their devotion to Yeenoghu, few gnolls had any interest in ritual and there were few   or   to be found among the savage packs. Typically, gnolls saw their very brutality as a sign of their devotion to the demon lord, painting the eye of Yeenoghu onto their weapons and armor and howling his name as a war cry in battle. \n Gnolls venerated Yeenoghu by celebrating their victories with demonic rituals and blood offerings. Occasionally, Yeenoghu rewarded such a celebrant by allowing the gnoll to be possessed by a demonic spirit, marking them as one of his chosen. Such gnolls were known as  . Hyenas that feasted upon the slain foe of one of the Fangs were transformed into full-grown gnolls, allowing fangs to quickly increase their population. \n A few gnolls were led, however, by   who made powerful pacts with the demonic servants of Yeenoghu and guided the packs they led through frightful visions paid for with even more horrific rituals. The most terrible of these were the Corruption of the Soul Consumed, where living victims were eaten alive by female hyenas who were then swiftly impregnated with   or   formed from the tormented souls of the dead, a conception that was followed by an even swifter birth. \n Those gnolls who turned away from the worship of Yeenoghu often embraced no deity, seeing no clear difference between demons and gods. Sometimes these gnolls sought the patronage of   spirits of the natural world, embracing the primal essence of nature. Others sought out the gods of other races.  The gnolls of back in the days of ancient   went so far as to make monthly pilgrimages to a   of  , worshiping any given   (who had a tradition of casting   spells on their hair) as \"lightened ones\". \n The worship of Yeenoghu had displaced the worship of the original gnoll god,  , with the number of gnolls still worshipping Gorellik in sharp decline.  The worship of Gorellik was for a while retained by the gnoll tribes of the  , but from   dwindled as Yeenoghu surged in popularity.  Less than a millennium later, Yeenoghu's purview over the gnolls was, for all practical purposes, complete. \n From Year of the Fanged Beast, 640 DR, the tribes following Yeenoghu in the Shaar were emboldened to attack the region around   with their newly acquired shamanistic power. \n By  , a tribe of gnolls took over the   in then-ruined and monster-infested  . The tribe was led by a chieftain and his three wives.  Curiously enough, the chieftain was a hulking  , an exceptionally rare breed. That creature was killed by a group of heroes of Phlan, including  ,  , and  . \n By    , the Zulkir of Alteration in   amassed a significant army of gnolls that were trained by   attracting the attention of Harpers, other zulkirs, and neighboring countries. Maligor targeted the up and coming Red Wizard   as a ploy to distract his opponent Szass Tam from the real target. The Zulkir of Alteration sent out his gnoll army to march on Rembert's territory promising the half of the land to Szass Tam who very likely was going to take the entire territory for himself before the gnoll army was to arrive. \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gnoll"},

As a result, it was not always possible to travel from one end of the Underdark to the other. The Underdark was divided into several domains that were similar to continents of the world above. While it was possible to travel from one place to another within a domain, separate domains tended to have very few passages linking them. The major domains of the Underdark were the  , the  , the  , the  , the  ,  , the  , and  . \n The Underdark's underground landscape varied from small subterranean fissures almost impossible for adventurers to crawl through to more conventional caves and caverns. But there were also wide expanses of deep water in which coral caves grew, blocks of ice that creatures hollowed out and dwelt inside, and cave-like spaces within masses of fungus or bone or else supported by bubbles of magical  . \n This varied landscape was as dynamic as the surface of Abeir-Toril. Some areas were always changing over time because of underground magma rivers or the emptying of underground lakes due to cracks in the rock formed by earthquakes. This meant maps of the Underdark were highly unreliable. \n The Underdark burrowed deep under the  , stretching between the continents of   and Faer\u00fbn. Ancient   legend talked about a great ancient war between the stout folk and the drow that raged in the depths underneath the Trackless Sea. The war was ended by drow magics that lit the tunnels with fires so hot they melted rock and flooded the portion of the Underdark that connected dwarves and drow who resided in the Maztican Underdark with their eastern kin.  In fact, the catastrophe was known as   and took place many dwarven generations before the \"discovery\" of Maztican continent by  . The calamity was caused by uncontrolled magics of the   harnessed by the drow. It left Underdark beneath Maztica believed to be uninhabitable, filled with poisonous gas and molten rock. The dwarves who became cut off from  , with passing centuries became   who lived in shallow caves close to the surface of the   desert. They believed that the Rockfire completely exterminated the drow and the rest of the dwarves. However, that was proven to be a false belief by the mid\u201314  century DR.  The Underdark passages between the two continents were believed to be lost legends, gone, and forgotten by inhabitants of Faer\u00fbn. \n When the   brought the continent of   to Toril, it also brought a part of the   below it. It was different from the Underdark of Faer\u00f9n, but besides that it was inhabited by drow and mysterious monsters, little was known about this region. \n The Underdark's environment varied vastly from the surface world, making adventuring through it a dangerous expedition. Just like when trekking through a desert, adventurers traversing the Underdark's passages needed to be well prepared. \n The Underdark was mainly without any source of light save for the occasional luminous rocks or  . Large portions of it were also without food or water, making well-stocked food supplies a must-have when exploring uncharted terrain underground. \n Lack of light combined with a tomb-like silence made traveling something only for the strong-hearted. The nerve-wracking silence made even experienced adventurers grow agitated. \n Just like deep dungeons, the air could grow stale and even poisonous in the Underdark. It could contain explosive gases from underground volcanic activity or other deadly gases bubbling out of deep fissures in the rock. Bad air and poisonous fumes could collect in portions of tunnels and caves more or less isolated from the main vaults and caverns. Siphon-like tunnels holding water could also trap these gases for a long time. \n The temperature underground varied according to depth and the proximity of thermal activities in the area. Throughout the year, the temperature remained stable and moderate in most regions, usually slightly clammy or chilly. The water underground was extremely cold and posed a hypothermia risk. \n The Underdark was inhabited by many races, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , \n Plant life and animal life could be as varied underground as on the surface, ranging from small insects to   or  , which set up their realms deep down.

They were hated and feared due to their cruelty,  though some non-evil and an even smaller number of good drow existed. \n In many ways, the drow resembled other   or  .  Their bodies were wiry and athletic,  while their faces were chiseled and attractive,  though they were shorter and thinner than other elven sub-races.  Due to a process of selective breeding that lasted for several generations,  the drow (especially nobles)  looked attractive  even in comparison to other elven subraces.  Though their alluring appearance could be used for seduction, it was more often utilized to instill fear.  According to the goblin  , the beauty standards of the surface races made them prone to turn a blind eye to the deeds of the drow, showing them greater leniency and acceptance. \n Reports varied on the physical differences between the drow sexes. Some purported that females were generally bigger and stronger than males,  while others claimed the males had superior strength.  Both sexes varied in height from 4\u202ffeet and \u200b7\u202finches\u200b to \u200b5\u202ffeet and \u200b5\u202finches (140\u200b to \u200b170\u202fcentimeters), averaging at 5\u202ffeet  (150\u202fcentimeters). Males weighed between 87\u200b to \u200b157\u202fpounds (39\u200b to \u200b71.2\u202fkilograms), averaging 109.5\u202fpounds  (49.67\u202fkilograms), while females were a bit lighter, weighing between 82\u200b to \u200b152\u202fpounds (37\u200b to \u200b68.9\u202fkilograms) and averaging 104.5\u202fpounds  (47.4\u202fkilograms). \n Drow skin tones ranged from dark grey,  jet-black,  and  ,  (with various shades of blue),  the albino drow known as the   being an exception.  Drow had white, black, or purple teeth, while their gums, tongues, and throats could be red, pink, or purple. \n Drow eyes could be of any color,  with bright red being the most common.  Pale shades  that appeared nearly white of blue, lilac, pink, or silver were also frequent.  Drow with green, brown, black, amber, or rose-hued eyes existed, but they were rare. Purple or blue eyes indicated surface   and/or   ancestry.  The color of a drow's eyes could also be indicative of their current mental or physical state; drow eyes reddened when they were angry, and turned yellow when they were sick, poisoned, or under some negative magical influence. \n Drow hair could be stark white,  pale yellow  and, more rarely, silver or copper in color.  It thinned and changed color with age, turning pale yellow for women, and silver or grey for men.  Due to the Eilistraeen ritual of  , drow of other faiths would often say that silver hair was a sign of mental handicap. \n Drow generally kept their hair long, and decorated it with pins and webbing made of precious metals.  They were incapable of growing proper beards, but some males managed to grow long sideburns or even tufts of wispy hair on the cheek or chin. \n The majority of drow wore a  , a fire-resistant, protective cloak, footwear that functioned as  , and a  . The latter showed the House or merchant clan to which a drow belonged, be it as a member or servant. However, with the exception of the First House, insignias weren't openly displayed except when inside the House territory or the clan's base. \n Noble drow wore clothes and equipment of superior quality (except, of course, when they didn't want to attract attention).  For example, a noble's   didn't just show house allegiance but also carried magic that could be used on command.   s' were considered fashionable by drow priestesses,  who also often used powdered  , an Underdark-moss, as eye shadow. \n Compared to other sentient beings, drow were notably intelligent, as having an analytical mindset and being observant at all times was needed to survive in their society.  Intellect, along with force of personality, were mental traits that had been ruthlessly selected for in their social darwinist civilization over several generations.  However, a lifetime of being indoctrinated with Lolth's dogma, combined with their upbringing giving them limited contact with other beings, surroundings, and alternative ways of life, made them close-minded, and left them with little worldly experience. \n The drow (fittingly for the dark perversions of the elves they were) were decadent  and hedonistic beings with a love for what they considered beautiful and a desire to surround themselves with such things, generally without paying attention to the cost of acquiring them.  For example, they were often lecherous, with a tendency to take lovers at their leisure and discard them at their whim.  However, the drow were able to (or at least tried to) hide some of their more heinous traits behind a veneer of sophistication. \n The moral code of the average drow was informed by the teachings of Lolth.  From birth, the drow were taught that they were superior to other races, and as such they believed themselves to be the ultimate beings.  This mindset created an arrogance so strong that drow could be incapable of viewing other creatures as their equals,  including members of their own kind; almost every drow believed themselves to be the epitome of their superior species.  The treatment reserved for non-drow ran the entire gamut from pets,  to slaves, to grudgingly respected partners if they proved themselves a military match for them, though never equals. \n As one might expect, this atmosphere of utter condescension meant that most drow generally felt entitled to do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to do it.  If a drow was not where they believed they should be, their pride demanded they blame someone else (sometimes everyone else) for their incorrect position.  They were also taught that they should crush those beneath them,  for cruelty was seen as a method of self-validation. Those who could not defend themselves, as the logic went, deserved to have cruelty inflicted on them, which would prove the superiority of the drow performing the torment.  They were a vengeful people by necessity, as not answering to slights with punishment was easily perceived as weakness by other drow, and was essentially the same as inviting exploitation, abuse, or even death. \n Most drow sought to rise in rank,  desiring the power over others that a higher station would provide.  Ironically for a race that put such a focus on individual merit, personal achievement and ability carried so little weight in their minds they had almost no notion of its worth. Military genius, battle prowess, magical capability, the ability to create, and all other skills had no intrinsic value to the dark elves. The idea of passion for one's career, and of an activity having worth in and of itself was alien; abilities and resources, whether obtained by training or granted by birth, only mattered insofar as it increased a drow's ability to advance in station, thus granting them more power over others. \n Given the scarcity of resources in the   and the limited chances for advancement within their society, most drow had to be aggressively competitive.  They had a propensity for violence, which was their favorite, even instinctive, form of conflict resolution, and they managed to fight this urge when waiting for a more propitious time to strike. \n As a general rule, drow living within a Lolthite society could not afford to show emotions like compassion or love, for they were easy to exploit  and drow often preferred emotional cruelty over causing physical harm.  The strife they constantly endured led them to be paranoid, with a fear of everyone and everything, from the potential loss of personal position, Lolth's favor, the loyalty (or even the threat of outright rebellion) of their inferiors, to punishment by their own superiors' hands. \n The end result of being raised in this environment was that the drow were untrusting sadists with a constant readiness to stab others in the back, both in the figurative and literal sense.  They were an emotionally stunted people  with a tenuous grasp on sanity (a trait they placed less importance on than cunning and deviousness) and scarred minds, among which relatively undamaged individuals were considered abnormal.  Most were incapable of trusting other creatures, no matter their race,  and were taught from an early age not to do so, as they were expected to advance at the expenses of others by any means, including treachery and even outright murder (although not overtly).  Even in moments of safety or relaxation, they were always alert and constantly expecting attacks of any kind, and were rarely surprised when such attacks did come. \n While the drow understood the advantage of forging bonds with others,  they did not see the value in honesty.  Forming relations with others was therefore a dangerous endeavor, and mostly temporary, since any alliance or cordial relationship could end in treachery. Drow normally went into engagements of this sort expecting the worst,   and alliances were always under scrutiny for signs of treachery, often ending violently. They were generally formed when the supposed ally was susceptible to blackmail, considered weak enough to not be a serious threat, or when cooperation was forced by the existence of a common enemy.  In fact, the mere inconvenience of maintaining the bond could be a reason to end it. \n For a race so chaotic in a society focused on individual advancement at the expense of others, the majority of drow strangely leant towards being   in alignment. The drow were, in many way, contradictory in outlook, cooperating to some degree almost in spite of their very nature. They simultaneously encouraged personal ambition and innovative problem solving (creativity being needed to get ahead of the older elites) while paradoxically placing the good of the many over the good of the individual and reinforcing staunch traditionalism. \n To achieve their individual desires required their society to retain at least some level of stability, and they were held tightly to tradition even if that code wasn't actually codified into law. In fact, the drow responded poorly to social norms being turned into written rules, obeying them primarily out of fear and social pressure (but obeying them nonetheless). This lead to the phenomenon where a lone drow would drift towards chaos, whereas a drow community would be forced to work together  , setting up rules to stabilize the power each individual wanted for themselves and allowing for cooperation beyond what chaos could typically create. \n Unlike creatures such as orcs,  drow had no innate inclination towards evil, with their morality having been colored by their society.  \"Good drow\" made up about 15% of the entire race, although most of them weren't actually of the good  , being merely   or  . Within Lolthite societies, even drow with a disposition towards what was considered good generally had problems developing a strong personal sense of morality. They generally behaved the same way as evil drow due to social pressure, as being soft in any way was lethal in drow society and often resulted in the death of such drow. \n Only truly exceptional \"good drow\", such as  , were capable of freeing themselves from a Lolthite society.  The majority were found out and sacrificed to Lolth, and those who managed to leave their settlements would often die in the dangerous wilderness of the Underdark.  Furthermore, even those who escaped the cruelties of the Underdark found it more difficult to form long-term friendships than most races did  and had to constantly be on the lookout for pursuers who could kill them. \n Drow were more agile than most humanoid races,  which, much like their higher intellects and force of personality, was a result of selective breeding over several generations.  Similarly, drow had a higher than normal tolerance for poison due to exposure over the course of countless generations. They had lesser resistance, in descending order, to the following kinds of toxins: non-drow sleep poisons,  ,   venom, and injected poisons. They had no special tolerance for contact poisons or to poison gases. \n Drow had tremendous resistance to  , with adults overcoming magic around half the time.  During infancy it fluctuated between almost non-existent and youth-level (resisting around two fifths of the time), stabilizing as they grew up.  It increased again when they reached adulthood, and could be trained even further,  but even if a drow's magic resistance was overcome, they could handle magical attacks quite well and had a better chance than other races at resisting them,  especially spells that attempted to bend their will. \n Drow also had a natural aptitude for audible mimicry, the entire race possessing the capacity to easily imitate the sound and tone of another person in a believable manner, especially if frequently exposed to the language they were using. \n Base powers were abilities that the drow could cast without any schooling, needing only simple practice. They varied slightly from person to person due to various reasons, including but not limited to genetics, personal talent, and divine favor. Drow magical abilities  were somehow tied to the  ,  the radiation of the  , and its intensity in the birthplace of a drow could influence their base powers.  These abilities could also vary in the same person temporarily, depending on their personal (mental and physical) health situation, age, and degree of training. For example, a dying drow could double the effectiveness of the own innate powers by super-charging them with her or his own life force. \n The drow could use their base powers once every day and, once employed, they could end the spell, move it around at their whim, or downsize it. Spells like   could end a base power's effect. Normally, a drow could not continue using these abilities when they started using another one, or started to cast a spell.  A common or untrained drow could neither use nor maintain their innate abilities under the effect of light that was as bright as, or brighter than, sunlight, as it impeded their concentration. \n A drow's innate   spell-like ability  could create a larger number of light motes than the normal spell, and provided better control as the power of the caster increased; for example, the light spheres could be moved further away from each other than normal.  Reports varied if it could also be cast once per day, as with the other base powers, or at will. \n In addition to the normal effects of a   spell,  which created an area that was impervious to normal sight and  , a drow's spell-like variant could also create a globe that could be moved around and grew in radius with the strength of the caster.  They could further enhance the spell-like ability to cast it more often, and learn to deepen it so that a     could not overpower it any more. \n Unlike the normal version of , a drow's spell-like version could create a glowing field that grew wider with the strength of the caster.  It could come in blue, green, or violet,  but while a drow could change these colors, they always manifested a certain one if they made no choice.  According to  , a drow's   worked by channeling  . \n Upon reaching a sufficient degree of expertise, the drow gained their so called \"mature powers\". These included the spell-like abilities  ,  , and  .  Particularly intelligent and powerful drow could maintain two inborn abilities, or one inborn ability and one normal spell, simultaneously, using   and   at the same time for example.  Like with base powers, it was normally impossible to cast mature powers in the presence of intense light.  \n Some drow were born with more magical power than normal, allowing them early access to their mature powers.  Such drow made up the noble class of their society, and among them this was a dominant trait.  Not only could nobles use both base and mature powers more than once per day, but every decade they gained another daily use, with centuries old nobility having virtually unlimited uses. Unlike commoners, they could attempt to cast their inborn abilities even in the presence of light, but they could only maintain one of their spells in this condition even when normally able to do more. \n Before the 1360s DR, the drow would gradually lose their base and mature powers, as well as their defenses against magic, if exposed to sunlight.  However, during the 1360s DR,  , guided by Eilistraee,  carved her rune in the   with the intent of preserving her own drow magic away from the Underdark,  but the act ended up allowing all drow to keep their powers on the surface.  Despite Eilistraee guiding Liriel, speculations were that Lolth also had a hand in the matter. \n Lolthtouched powers, the result of  's blessing, were perhaps the most distinctive abilities of the drow.  Lolth's touch gave her a hold over the entire drow race, and overcoming it was only possible by becoming a   who also managed to be judged worthy by  . \n Lolthtouched drow manifested abilities like  , which would enshroud the given drow in shadow that was impossible for anyone but the caster to see through, and  , which made other creatures an easier target by surrounding them in harmless purple flames. Lolthtouched powers were seemingly fueled by the same source, and the use of such abilities were tiring for the drow, with only more experienced and well-trained drow able to cast both abilities separately.  Through training, drow could manifest the so-called   that both slowed and impeded a foe, while also limiting their vision. \n  drow could unlock even more Lolthtouched powers, including improvements of the aforementioned   and   abilities. Other ways to improve these abilities included training to cast the   faster in response to harm, or to turn the   into a flickering protective shroud that made the beneficiary harder to hit. \n Drow were as frail as any other elves,  and had a fascination with stealth and subtlety.  They had a tendency to ambush their enemies with ranged weaponry, choosing   when possible, to deliver their poisons from afar. They also favored light and quick weapons like   in melee but normally retreated if close combat was the only remaining option.  \n Specific training was available for their  ,  which included lessons on how to blend in with the heat hues and patterns of their surroundings, similarly to how other races could hide in the shadows of light sources.  Their famous (or infamous)   schools doubled as assassins' guilds.  Male drow were normally competent  ,  and   were also valued as scouts. \n Apart from its obvious use as a light source, drow used their ability to create   to surprise the enemy with the sudden appearance of a glowing figure or  -like light balls. Teaming up with actual will-o'-wisps to make this more effective was a known technique, however, this was viewed as corrupted behavior. \n Besides the obvious utility of cancelling light sources, the drow ability to create   was an integral part of their combat strategy, as it could be used to limit sight or otherwise hamper their enemies.  Since magical   looked like black stone when looked at with  , there were many creative uses of the spell form a tactical standpoint. For example, a drow could hide behind the \"black stone\" and ambush their enemies from behind the cover, or use it to cover up a pitfall. \n Like dancing lights, faerie fire could be used as a diversion, but the ability to change the colors of the lights allowed for the creation of color signals for the purpose of long distance communication. \n Lolthtouched drow sometimes trained to slip into the cover of their created darkness,  or learnt to hit the targets of   not just more accurately, but also harder, similarly to how   did. \n The drow had a number of combat styles:\n Drow   and   were made out of a substance called  , an alloy of  , and then turned into   items. Such equipment could not withstand sunlight,  but was cheap and easy to produce.  Before the 1370s DR, every drow warrior, down to the lowest rank, was equipped with a drowcraft   and (in most cases)   as well.  At some point during the early 1370s, these items fell out of favor  and the drow started to wear   armor when it was affordable, but they kept using armor that wouldn't hamper their natural dexterity. \n Famous weapons included the  ,  ,  ,   ,  , and the  . A well-known drow-made piece of gear was the  , legendary in the Underdark.  The drow created some weapons with the specific purpose to fight their own kind, namely the   and  . \n Among the Underdark races, the drow were the most skilled in the use of poisons and toxins.  Especially famous was the powerful  , made from a slippery black fungus that grew in certain   caverns, and commonly applied to crossbow bolts to easily put enemies to sleep.  Other popular poisons were those extracted from  ,  , and  ,  the so-called  , the  , and the  .\n Almost every drow put some individual effort into strengthening their tolerance to poisons as part of their training. This was done by ingesting ever-larger doses of   and of   venom, granting them further resistance to such toxins.  \n Their massive use of poisons led the drow to developed the   to enhance the effects of any toxin applied to their weapons.  Naturally, the drow had some countermeasures against poison, like the  . \n The priestesses of drow societies formally occupied the positions of military leadership, but in practice it was the male commanders that actually led such forces. The priestesses often hid away in the face of danger, while resorting to the use of corporal threats and magical domination to ensure loyalty.  A military squad formally led by a male drow,  was either a  , a suicide squad, or a  , a group of outcasts. \n When drow nobles warred against each other, the attacking side had to eradicate the entire enemy family in a single attack. If even one member of the defending family survived, they could apply for \"justice\", and the entire city would turn on the attackers. Alliances were not allowed in these kinds of attacks, and there was a minimum interim time (one year) between attacks on an individual house, giving them time to recuperate.  Prolonged covert warfare between two houses, by means like assassination, were not exactly forbidden, but it was only tolerated for a time counted in years, after which the drow city's ruling council forced the two houses to enter open war. \n This was the reason why drow society was in a perpetual state of very small-scale battle of underhandedness, instead of a series of bloody frontal battles.  Making matters worse for the drow, in war situations, the noble Houses schemed against each other so that their rivals would take the heaviest losses, or carry the responsibility for any failure, meaning that they were incapable of forming a truly united front against their enemies. \n War in the   was far different from conflicts fought on the surface. The cramped space of the subterranean environment made it hard or ineffectual to amass giant armies, and most battles were actually skirmishes between small units or patrols.  The drow avoided large sieges and pitched battles, in favor of focusing on skirmishes, as well as hit-and-run tactics and harrying strikes. \n Underground warfare heavily involved the use of the natural environment as a weapon through the creation of tunnels to flank enemies, cause cave-ins, change the flow of magma, and so on.  The drow used ambush tactics that exploited existing dangers like loose rocks, and were skilled in using traps, such as deliberately placed   or glasses full of  -spores, to gain an advantage in combat. \n The drow also had a knack for responding to their enemies' actions, including spellcasting.  The members of a patrol coordinated by using   and counting what they called \"handfades\", a unit of time based on how long it took a rock to lose all heat after being touched by a hand.  However, they were aggressive, if not outright impatient, and one way to gain an advantage on them was to taunt their warriors long enough for them to make a fatal mistake.  Their method of warfare, especially considering their enlistment of slaves and allies, could drag on for years. \n While the exact equipment and size of drow warbands varied from place to place, it was possible to make some general assumptions about the composition.\n A drow patrol usually consisted of seven to twelve soldiers headed by a patrol leader and overseen by a commander, the latter of which normally had a maximum of three other individuals, either acolytes and apprentices or bodyguards, in tow. Ordinary drow patrols contained a maximum of around six individuals with basic training, the rest being elite warriors. These warbands normally included a mix of both male and female drow, with a homogenous patrol likely indicating that the tension between the sexes in their city was reaching a critical point. \n Patrol leaders were normally male drow with superior fighting skills or clerics trained in the use of weapons.  Larger patrols were generally led by female drow, who normally had one or two powerful warriors as lieutenants.  An elite patrol was usually led by a female cleric with female bodyguards, and her \"acolytes\" were also female clerics of the same church. These patrols were special, for they had an additional cleric with healing duties who also worked as a spy for the church of Lolth. \n A \"pincer\" was the name for a collection of several patrols (two to four) led by one commander, usually some kind of spellcaster called an \"overleader\" or \"battle-captain\", who had up to four lieutenants called \"webmasters\".  Ranking higher than battle-captains were \"battle-lords\" or \"warmistresses\" which had an entire patrol force as their bodyguards and to carry their magic items. Each House had a standing army of drow soldiers, priestesses, and wizards, which included contingents consisting solely of non-drow slaves, usually  ,  , and  . \n Around three out of every ten drow patrols included somewhere between one to eight non-drow, such as bugbears,  , or   as \"allied forces\".   were never a part of such groups, except when being escorted to a destination.  When a drow died in battle, they were sometimes reanimated as a   if the lower half of the body was still functional. This was done to prevent the corpse from getting plundered, to provide the corpses a method of self-transportation, to provide the injured and immobile dead bodies with transportation, and to gain useful shock troops to use in battle. \n All warriors in a patrol usually equipped with  ,  , up to three   (with an atlatl to extend their reach), a   with ten poisoned darts, and a   for protection.  Patrol leaders were equipped with a hand crossbow, javelins with an atlatl, and a moderately enchanted mace to indicate their authority. :During wartime, the patrols doubled their numbers of poisoned darts, and every warrior was equipped with up to three   in steel vials that didn't rust. \n Patrols were outfitted with a scroll of   to guard against cave-ins, while surface raiders or underground furtive attackers used an   to allow stealthy attacks. \n Lolthite, drow society had had two nominal goals, called \"the First and Second Part of the Destiny of the People\". The former was about forcing all other races of the Underdark into subservience, while the latter was about driving the entire elven population into extinction, seizing their lands and holdings in the process.  Lolth claimed that, in order to achieve such goals, the drow had to be in a state of perpetual infighting and violent competition, the constant training serving to make them stronger and smarter while breeding out indolence and other weaknesses.\n However, the extreme, self-destructive degree to which the Darwinian attitude of the drow was taken prevented them from achieving either of their purposes, barring possibilities for significant growth.  In truth, despite her rhetoric, Lolth had no intention of having the drow devote themselves to reaching their supposed goal. She found their in-fighting far too enjoyable to focus their attention of taking the surface. \n On a personal level, each drow tried to gain and maintain the favor of Lolth, amass material goods (like wealth and slaves), and gain status inside their society.  Depending on the station of a drow, there was a difference in the kind of plans they supported and executed. Drow of higher standing supported endeavors to boost their own prestige by increasing their own people's power and influence. Drow of lower station supported plans that dragged everybody down, for example by causing strife and violence within their communities. \n Drow communities were known as city-states, although they weren't actually organized as \"states\", as much as clusters of drow led by oppressive, theocratic nobility. Cities were normally independent and not part of a larger drow nation, and though some had trade agreements, most frequently fell to war with one another.  Cities usually included farmlands, where slaves worked to produce and harvest meat and crops.  Those lands were usually found inside the main cavern but sometimes, usually due to space limits, they could be found outside as well. \n Drow architecture, like typical elven works of construction,  put an emphasis on beauty and was considered a marvel to behold.  The drow were the best architects when it came to shaping and hollowing out stalactites, stalagmites, and cave columns. They were also known for their stone bridge, balcony, and buttress designs, as well as their intricate spiral tunnels. Suspension bridges were the norm, for they could withstand earthquakes, and   were trained for the purpose of slinging their lines. \n The drow used the very environment of the Underdark as material for their architecture, and could make use of growing sedimentary structures to shape their buildings.  They were particularly interested in the    , because creatures with darkvision could see through it.  In some cities, clay was used by the poor, similarly to how it was used in   and the  , to create dwellings. The same craft was used by the rich to create temporary furniture and sculptures for their parties, which were then decorated with gems, glowing fungi, and similar material.  As far as dwellings went, noble drow usually lived in their mansions while the commoners lived in either small caves or walled, circular houses with dug-out cellars and adobe-like construction, both designed to be as beautiful as possible. \n Despite their excellent craftsmanship, drow cities tended to be a chaotic and messy sight because of the lack of a uniform architectural style.  Common features in drow cities were the presence of spider webs in passages and layouts of buildings,  and frequent obsidian-cast spider motifs as decorations.  Lighting was created both through   and mundane means, with the former being far more common,  and the   spell commonly adorned particularly impressive structures, the borders and landmarks of a given city-state, buildings belonging to the wealthy, as well as the working places for slaves outside of the city.  \n Magic in general was a key element in drow architecture, with crucial structures often supported by spells rather than being carefully built to stand on their own (which could cause them to collapse when the magic wore off). In the event of collapse, rubble was cleaned out by slaves, only for the drow to use magic like   and the barest minimum amount of handiwork for reconstruction. It was this slapdash approach to their architecture that meant that instability issues in drow cities had a tendency to persist. \n The drow were mostly met in the  , but the majority of their cities were found in the   as a protection against aggressions from the surface. In fact, traveling all the distance down to the Middledark with an army from the surface wasn't a feasible undertaking.  The gates of a drow city, as well as its important buildings, usually had   guardians. \n The places in the Underdark where drow built their city-states had to meet sevaral criteria. The caverns had to be huge,  allowing a horizontal layout of the city,  great amounts of  ,  , and   needed to be nearby, and the magnetic force and the faerzress needed to be particularly intense,  both for practical reasons and, according to  , because the drow had a mental compulsion to be near the radiation and were drawn to it.  Whatever the reason, when the faerzress disappeared, the drow-city usually collapsed too. \n The faerzress radiation near most drow cities provided protection from magical spying via  , and also made it difficult, or even dangerous, to teleport within the area.  Furthermore, the faerzress allowed cheap and easy creation of magic,   items,  and the radiation had several defensive purposes.  For example, drow often used  , a type of fungi that grew in faerzress-rich places, to warn them of incoming danger. \n However, the drow's relationship with faerazress could be as much a weakness as it was a strength. Their over-reliance on it meant that drow settlements were often stationary, leaving them relatively easy to locate and vulnerable to attack by various the forces of the Underdark.  The radiation was also uniquely capable of causing mutations in other creatures; a flying  , for example, could be born in a faerazress-rich environment. If the product of such mutations was powerful, drow tried to avoid fighting it and keep it within a certain area so that would-be invaders would have to face it instead, turning it into an unwitting sentry. If the creature had a spider-like appearance, the drow would praise it as the work of Lolth and occasionally feed it with captives or lured adventurers. \n A specialty of the drow was their ability to cut and shape stone, both with magical and mundane methods, to produce smooth-flowing buildings, and waterworks were a product of drow craftsmanship that received universal acclaim. Systems of intricately curved pipes that bore through solid rock, fitted with shut-off valves, side-channels, and pumps, collected and diverted water for various purposes, from dietary, to industrial, to waste disposal. \n The valves were big, hollow stone spheres with two opposed holes, closely fitted into a basin, which had both inlet and outlet channels. They were attached to a large, counter-weighted lever that, when turned, lined up the inlet and outlet channels with the holes of the valve to let water come through. The flow was regulated by opening a sliding panel, which turned the sphere in such a direction that only the volume of water that filled it could pass through and be diverted towards a side-channel. The aforementioned pumps had two varieties: a corkscrew-type, that worked by water pressure, and a piston type, worked by slaves. Constant application of magic was needed to make the water seals function perfectly. \n Most members of a Lolthite drow society lived under oppression, in a state of perpetual desperation and poverty.  Commoners normally learned a craft or entered military training, while talented individuals could hope to enter one of the magic schools. Ironically, commoners had a greater number of multi-generation households, since their relatives had less to gain from their death, resulting in families who had many living generations of members. There also wasn't much to be gained from killing an elder (at least one that wasn't feeble), as they represented a valuable source of historical and general knowledge with realistic accessibility,  although they elderly would be eaten if the city was faced with overpopulation. \n Commoners who gained enough expertise in a certain area, like   as a warrior, might be adopted into a noble family.  From time to time, artists were adopted by one of the Houses for their skill.  Commoners could also rise to a higher social station by becoming the consort of a noble, gaining the latter's last name for the duration of the marriage. \n Consort bonds were generally of temporary nature, however, due to accidental breeches of etiquette, the noble's disinterest, or because they were simply being used as a pawn in the political games of Lolthite society. The outcome was either a painful death or expulsion\u2014usually the former.  In general, rising through the ranks too quickly was dangerous for any drow, as the usual reaction was the formation of temporary alliances among those who believed they wronged to take the upstart down and such alliances were often successful.  Nonetheless, noble drow valued commoners more than slaves, and usually sacrificed them only if a slave was not at hand.  \n \n Drow were ruled by their aristocracy, the drow Houses, made up by the families that had the strength and incredible influence to occupy the best lands,  with most Houses often being located in close proximity to each other. While the nobles hoarded the best territory and resources, the rest of the population was forced to fend for themselves. These priestesses of Lolth that normally reigned over drow societies were poor rulers who tossed their cities into a haphazard organization.  \n Noble Houses constantly fought each other  but were also characterized by internal strife,  as expected in a society that followed the Way of Lolth.  Though the power of the many Houses changed often, the few at the top usually remained stable.  A good indicator of a drow House's power was the grandeur of their domain, with the biggest, grandest villas belonging the the greatest Houses,  and a public temple to Lolth often being built within the strongest family's territory.  Not only did the infighting of drow Houses paralyze the growth of their own cities,  but they actively undermined opportunities and chances for any form of development in order to ensure that those below them didn't gain power (and with it, the option to turn away from Lolth). \n Drow Houses were founded by powerful drow individuals with special powers, whose traits would be passed to their offspring (see  ), and further augmented with magic items. Within a family, noble drow parents viewed their children as vehicles for their own advancement, a mindset which included sacrificing them for some potential gain. Noble drow families banded together for mutual protection and not out of affection. Noble drow stayed with their family as children to protect themselves from outside violence, and as adults because Houses proved to be good tools for societal advancement. \n The head of a noble House was a matron mother, a powerful priestess of Lolth. Below her, in descending order of influence, were the female members of the House, who were also priestesses.  After them came male officers, including the weapon master, House wizard, and patron (the matron's consort), although these positions could be combined. Then came the other male members of the House (war-leaders, who answered to the weapon master, and House mages, subservient to the House wizard). Below the non-officer males (who were normally of the House's bloodline) were servants and slaves. Positions were normally sorted by age but were ultimately not set in stone, and could be changed at the matron mother's whims. \n Females had absolute power within their household, and owned all the governmental and militaristic power within the city, although they held no authority until after puberty. Males never held any authority unless they managed to become an officer. In most cases, a matron only lost her position if murdered by her eldest daughter. This usually marked a new direction for the House, and sometimes even its destruction, because the murder of a matron was seen as a sign of disfavor from Lolth. \n A Lolthite drow society was a theocracy with ultimate, absolute power invested in the ruling priestesses, particularly the matron mothers. Technically the only rule was \"might makes right\",  and the priestesses were judge, jury, and executioner (or whatever other punishment they saw fit to enact). There were no concepts like \"guilt until proven innocent\" or \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt\".   The priestesses saw it as their right to arrest and punish people for assumed offenses via methods they made up on the spot, and the only way to lessen a punishment was for the presumed criminal to have connections to those that the punishing priestess or priestesses considered a threat. \n However, as the priestesses had power invested in them by the Spider Queen, the actual basis of drow society law was the Way of Lolth.  The priestesses of the Spider Queen forced others to comply with Lolth's dogma, which in turn became the main law.  Fittingly, one of the main tenets (the first one, in fact) was that Lolth was the only true goddess, and that anyone worshiping another deity or practicing a different faith was to be sacrificed to Lolth. Ritual worship by non-drow was punished with a heavy fine and temporary exile from the city with second offenses carrying the death penalty, along with first-time offenses by drow. To even utter another god's name was frowned upon, although not a real cause for punishment. \n While violence and property crime was punished in drow society, it wasn't because such acts were believed to be morally wrong. A drow vandal, petty thief, or burglar would face charges, but the stolen goods would not be hunted down since, in drow eyes, the fact that the previous owner couldn't defend it meant that they didn't deserve to keep it. Similarly street patrols violently punished anyone fighting, but the victim of the assault was expected to defend themselves against their assailants. Even drow Houses were punished for the open murder of their enemies, just as they would if their assassination was exposed, but this was because public fighting was considered boorish. \n In truth, drow law was nothing more than a formal excuse for cruelty, an ironic parody of order made only to disguise the chaotic, ruthless, murderous ambition of the drow and their infighting. For the most part, there was no prescribed criteria for how justice was to be performed, and punishments could very easily be wildly disproportionate to the crime. \"Justice\" was a senseless and arbitrary institution with no due process or appeals system (unless one counted leveraging their connections) capriciously enforced at the cruel whims of the ruling tyrants. Though certain acts did carry penalties, the only actual crime (the part they were truly being punished for) was getting caught.  \n It was considered a violation of the Way of Lolth to defy the hierarchy of their society in any way. This included but was not limited to killing spiders (which was possibly not an actual rule, but could be considered taboo), a slave disobeying their owners in any way, a commoner refusing the orders of a priestess (an exception being if the commoner belonged to another house, although even then the offended priestess was often allowed to flog them), and a student refusing the \"courting\" of a matron or female teacher.  \n Drow society also had a strict fashion code (which included rules about hairstyles) meant to allow easy identification of a drow's social station and House (if any). Any drow who committed identification litigations by wearing the wrong hair style, clothes, and/or   was considered a criminal unless the House authorized the use of their color or insignia or if the matron mother expressedly permitted a drow to change their hair and attire to appear as a different rank. It was also illegal for non-drow to disguise themselves as a specific drow, a noble drow, or a member of a House outside of the one they belonged to. \n Failing to completely exterminate the drow noble line of another House in a single attack, more than one House teaming up to attack another (one of the few offenses that had to be proven) or attacking a drow House within a year of the last attack against them were all offenses. \n Given the wickedly whimsical nature of drow law, punishment for many of the above offenses (especially refusing one's superiors) could range from immediate execution, death by torture, torture without death, mutilation, castration, imprisonment, exile, forced labor, whipping, and exorbitant fines (which the priestess could keep). Whipping and torture were the most common penalties since the priestesses enjoyed punishments that could be inflicted multiple times. Violation of the fashion code, disregarding exceptions due to authorization by the appropriate individuals, was always punished by death. \n Failing to fully obliterate another House or allying with another to do so was a crime punished by all other Houses destroying the offenders. While attacking a House in short succession wasn't technically punished by law, the offending Houses's priestesses would lose Lolth's favor and be unable to cast spells until they performed a great deed to regain it. This practically assured a House's destruction as they were forced to fall back on diplomatic and physical methods of defense, with all other Houses able to attack them with impunity. \n Under Lolth's dogma, female drow were recognized as being more valuable than males, who were considered worthless. This gave female drow absolute power over males,  and meant they were less likely to be sacrificed.  It would be easy to imagine, therefore, that drow females, had it much easier compared to males, but this was merely an illusion. In drow society, where rank was power and power was everything, a prestigious position came at a high cost. Drow ambition combined with the other teachings of Lolth meant that the competition between female drow, particularly those who belonged to powerful houses, was violent, aggressive, and lethal in a way that males didn't have to deal with. It was even worse for those women who sought power outside of Lolth's church, for they had to compete both with other females and oppressed and resentful men. \n Still, males who hoped to find any place of power often resorted to ends as treacherous as the women that ruled the drow. Men generally tried currying favors with women, attempting to advance their station by attaching themselves to them. For example, some tried to gain high officer positions or win a coveted place as the consort of a powerful matron mother.  Drow \"courting\" was the domain of women in Lolthite society, and for a male to try initiate a relationship was a form of insubordination and a reason for execution by torture and sacrifice. In general, drow women chose their partners as animals would be chosen for breeding purposes, with males expected not to resist the other's affections. Males had no input on when the relationship would start or end, while females could do so at their leisure, at least in theory. \n When a drow male was desired by more than one female, the latter would compete over him. This was by no means a positive circumstance for the male, as a female who lost might decide that if she couldn't have them then no one would. More than once a female would \"give up\" on a male before flaying him and leaving his corpse in a rival's bedchambers,  and a discarded male would more likely end up dead than left alone. Among commoner drow and in non-Lolthite socieites, matters weren't so extreme. The concept of marriage existed, but was not as permanent, with contracts lasting for a decade or so at longest with the potential for renewal. Merchant clans followed similar rules, but marrying into a clan meant being part of it for life, and trying to leave could be the same as inviting death. \n A working long-term relationship between drow was likely not the result of love, but due to tangible reasons, like complementary careers, political influence, attractiveness, or the male having a history of fathering many female offspring. Any actual affection was usually the result of the male being attractive, servile, and never embarrassing the female. The best \"normal\" romantic relationship between two drow was similar to the one between a spoiled brat and her well trained, obedient dog, with the owner having the right to put the dog down for any reason. \n Arcane magic was a route for power for male drow, though open only to a few. While they were still socially inferior to female drow, they weren\u2019t in real danger of being killed by a priestess, while even accomplished male war commanders were in danger of being executed for perceived insults.  Other ways of gaining station as a male were to become an   (but it didn't grant any additional safety), or an  , taking advantage of the reverence of   that came with the worship of Lolth. \n Male clerics existed among the drow, but in  -dominated cities, they were targets of her female followers, and Lolth barred them from achieving power beyond a certain threshold. They served in low-ranking positions under lethal risks,  and though capable of becoming  , it often caused the priestesses to kill them.  Other drow deities had different approaches to gender.   had no gender restrictions,  while  's faith had a gender barrier that made it harder for women to become his clerics. \n  accepted clergy of all genders and races, although before the 1370s DR, her actual clerics could only be female.  This was less due to any supposed inferiority of males, but because becoming one required a greater understanding and sensitivity of the \"life of the other gender\u201d. For lack of better terminology, one simply couldn't truly feel the Divine Dance of Eilistraee \"properly\" except as a female, and so her rare and secretive male priests had to spend some time as a female, not just for the duration of a ritual called the Changedance, but in everyday ways. However, during the 1370s DR, Eilistraee started working towards opening up to male priesthood: for a time, males still had a harder time becoming clerics (see also  ),  but after the  , Eilistraee's clergy could be accessed by people of any gender with equal ease. \n Given the need to compete for limited resources and advancement opportunities in their society, drow had an interesting relationship with children. On some level drow recognized that the children were the future of their race, the vulnerability of young drow to magic for example having led to the development of the  .  However, an honest bond of love between parent and child in drow society was even rarer than one between lovers. Instead, the relationship between drow and their children was frequently one of mutual exploitation, each using the other as a tool only so long as they still needed them.  A child born with physical malformations or imperfections, due to the drow obsession with beauty, was killed shortly after birth.  \n Due to their competitive society, drow tried to instill the ideals of tenacity, cruelty, ambition,  self-reliance, and independence in their children.  Since traits like kindness or compassion were considered dangerous and exploitable,  children who showed such weakness were punished. Punishment ranged from beatings to neglect, such as withholding food, with the goal of the abusive treatment being to prepare the child for the cruelty of their future lives. These punishments could prove lethal, and the inevitable child deaths were justified as \"saving\" the child from an even worse fate as an adult. Drow children learned cruelty and bloodthirst both as a survival mechanism, and as a defensive mechanism to escape punishment, and these lessons generally scarred a drow and stuck with them for life. \n This was when a drow's parents were actually   the drow's life. Noble drow weren't raised by their parents, whom they only rarely saw a few times a year, but by elder siblings and private caretakers before being sent to the city's priesthood, military, or wizard academy depending on gender and inclination. In effect, each was a kind of boarding school for children over ten years old, which normally only allowed them to return home once per year for important family or religious meetings.  Merchant clans  and commoners (who lacked the resources to hire tutors) considered raising children the entire family's duty, before they learned the parent's craft, enrolled in the military, or joined a wizard or cleric academy. Whether noble or commoner, children generally lacked any strong parental bonds, being both physically and emotionally distant to their absentee parents, thus limiting the emotional growth they could achieve in a more normal (by surface standards) home environment. \n The drow held some respect towards races capable of resisting their aggressions,  and could perceive certain races as at least possible equals (though never superiors) with whom they had mutual gain or non-aggression pacts. However, contracts with \"lesser races\" were not seen as actually binding, and were readily broken as soon as they stopped being beneficial to the drow party. As a result, the other races learned to anticipate betrayal and always had counters to the treachery prepared.  Normally the drow had poor opinions of even their erstwhile allies, and viewed other races, at best, as merely laughable or contemptible. \n The drow's ultimately viewed other races as somewhere between targets of extermination and potential slaves,  foes to be either dominated or, if they were a threat driven to extinction. As such, drow had an extremist mentality when meeting with them, their first thought being to wage war on the new neighbors in order to subjugate or eradicate them. Prisoners of such violent activities were the source of slaves in their cities.  Normally somewhere between half and two-thirds of a given drow settlement's population consisted of slaves or other non-drow without rights,  although only Houses possessed significant amounts of slaves. In some cases the  number was rarely above the House's drow population  and in others the slaves outnumbered them either two or three to one. \n As a general rule, the inhabitants of  's surface knew very little about the drow. To the average person, the drow were such a distant problem that they were considered more like myth than reality.  Given that they couldn't do anything effectively in bright light, drow were inactive on the surface during the day.  As a rule of thumb, only 5% of surface inhabitants had the superficial knowledge that the drow were \"inhabitants of the   who conducted raids on the surface\", not including elves and eladrin, who had close historical connections. This made it easier for individual drow to enter surface communities without meeting hostility as long as they didn't do or say something that could catch attention and lead people who had real knowledge about the drow to cleanse their community of the threat the drow represented. \n Even so, surface cities generally didn't allow drow into their cities because of their reputation,  though followers of   sometimes managed to gain a place within surface communities.  Their unique appearance combined with their negative public image made it practically impossible for them to effectively replenish their resources on the surface.  Intelligent creatures on nearly every plane in existence knew of, and maintained at least a respect for, the drow. \n The drow didn't often keep animals as pets, preferring to keep creatures that could completely comprehend their dependence on their owners. Instead, many drow took a favored slave as a personal servant or thrall, slaves that were treated as little more than pets. They did however, domesticate a number of animals for various purposes, and were known to take advanage of molds, fungi, and   by using them as traps and for sanitation. \n Barring the most primitive among them, the drow were a literate race.  As was common for  , drow speech was quite eloquent and their speech was almost musical.  Most drow only knew two languages, namely Deep Drow and the Sign language, since they usually stayed in their cities and therefore had limited exposure to or need to learn other tongues. However, drow adventurers, outcasts, and slave-traders often learned more languages,  as did their warriors.  Drow were known to use their ability to read subtle markings in stone to leave secret messages. \n Drow names often included double letters and were designed to be pleasant to the ear.  They believed that having first names similar to those of the   guaranteed misfortune, and names similar to that of their patron was considered blasphemy.  Nobles had a strong tendency to avoid giving names that were similar in sound to the common tongue of Deep Drow.  Drow last names never started with the \"L\"-sound like that of \"Lolth\",  \"Lloth\", or \"Loethe\", as this was reserved for the Spider Queen's avatar. Holding a last name, in general, meant that the holder was either born into a noble family, or had a rank and role (like weapon master) in a household. Drow that didn't meet those criteria weren't allowed to have a surname. \n The drow had a number of customs and gestures. For example, it was a commonly accepted gesture to drop held weapons and fall on a knee as a sign of surrender. There were many rituals as well, like the graduation ceremony for the graduates of the mage, priest, and warrior schools.  When participating in a meeting, due to their weakness to light, the creation of an intense light source was seen as a hostile act by the drow, that led them to attack. \n Some known drow rituals and customs included:\n Due to the dark elf love of beauty, the demand for art and skilled craft, particularly exquisitely forged weapons, was high.  Good artisans, especially innovative ones (which made up about 0.1-0.4% of the population), were highly sought after by the noble Houses. Families that didn't produce artistic talent on their own acquired it from the outside (be it by simple hiring, forceful coercion, or the rare adoption into the family).  Noble households often had their own exclusive sculptors and gemcutters. \n About a fifth of the entire drow race was capable of complex works, while only about one-tenth could create items fine enough to be enchanted or turned into   through the absorption of  . Even though capable artisans weren't few among the drow, there was a great shortage of such talents compared to the demand, and both nobles and merchant clans tried to have at least six on their payroll. Overall, artisans were among the most intrigant and paranoid drow. They used tricky devices like clothes with built-in items, gas-powered needle-throwers, extensile mechanical hands, wire-saws, and similar devices to defend themselves and break out of cages and prisons. \n Artwork and craftwork of the drow were often made out of materials like metal and cloth. They frequently included spider motifs, such as the curtains positioned to emulate spider webs that often adorned noble Houses.  An art form unique to the drow was the use of   to create murals or to highlight temples. \n Almost all drow were born into typical drow culture, and were known as  . These were by far the most common type of drow, and the only type known to most.  Drow that remained loyal to Lolth were known as  . \n Not all Udadrow became a part of the violent mainstream culture that most of the race were forced to endure. Those few who escaped the life of the Underdark could break away entirely from their dark past, while some fortunate drow were actually born and raised outside of the world below. Some drow found virtue within themselves in spite of all the terrors they witnessed (or perhaps because of it). Others turned to better ways either out of guilt or simply because they were no longer forced to obey Lolth's dogma. Still others were dangerously insane, broken by the horrors that shook their psyches.  \n The drow who chose to live on the surface, outside of the churches of Eilistraee and Vhaeraun, did not form any kind of organized society and instead lived as hermits and outcasts. They would interact with other societies when needed, but not out of choice.  Drow who wandered the surface in an attempt to settle their conflict with Lolth and each other were known as  . \n Though many drow followed the way of Lolth and became Udadrow, some rejected her. A mysterious band of drow headed to the far north and were seemingly never heard of again. This offshoot of drow became starlight elves, Aevendrow, who were skilled mages and lived in a much more free society. They were incredibly secretive in nature and virtually unknown, even by the oldest elves of Toril, living in their icy home of  . \n Similarly to the Aevendrow, the greenshadow elves, or Lorendrow, were a practically unheard of group of drow that rejected Lolth's teachings. This group headed south to a tropical jungle environment and drew power from the environment itself. Such drow were very wise and sought to live harmoniously with nature in their forest city of  . \n The majority of all drow worshiped a group of divine entities they collectively referred to as the  , a name intended to mock the original Seldarine.  Though having a group name might suggest some sort of alliance, the Dark Seldarine was a pantheon only in name. The only thing that technically united them all, outside of a few short-lived alliances, was that each was a deity revered by a fraction of the drow.  With few exceptions, every entity within the Dark Seldarine demanded absolute fealty from its adherents.  The Way of Lolth, for example, made clear that Lolth was the only true divine being, and to follow any other faith would bring down a series of awful punishments on the perpetrator, including death. \n Unlike the elves, who often venerated one member of their pantheon above the others while still paying homage to each of their deities,  the drow would choose one, sometimes two, gods or goddesses from their pantheon and ignore the rest.  As a result, while deities like  ,  , and   had millions of worshipers  but only 135,000, 250,000, and 100,000 dedicated church members respectively,  the number of worshipers of a Dark Seladrine member was nearly equal to the size of their church.  \n The relationship between the drow and their gods was one of mutual exploitation (with the exception of the one  -aligned member,  ). Most were not worshiped out of any sense of true piety or devotion, but out of fear, respect, and/or personal ambition. Likewise, most drow gods were intimately involved in the lives of their followers, but not because they genuinely cared about them; each demanded total, exclusive obedience, and did not care what happened to them outside of how it affected their personal power. \n There were two major faiths among the drow: \n The drow as a whole held to many different religions outside of those accepted by most of their society. It was believed that the \"good drow\" collectively worshiped  ,  drow goddess of freedom,  although in truth the more morally neutral of the \"good drow\" were split between the worship of  ,  , Lolth, and Vhaeraun.  Some drow living in   also followed the gods of the Seldarine.  The following faiths were of minor importance: \n The magic of the drow was on par with that found on the surface. \n There was a number of spells  , but not all had been developed by them. While they were known for the ability to create spells, and some of the magic known on the surface had also independently been developed by the drow, they also stole quite a lot of arcane knowledge from the surface by kidnapping casters during their raids.  For example, the   spell was originally developed by the  ,  but was still considered drow.  The drow had also created a number of spells that summoned or imitated spiders and their webs, like  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . \n Drow were not just avid inventors of magic items,  but also the main crafters of magic items in the Underdark.  Similarly to spells, while some items were  , not all had been developed by them, as they were known to steal magic items and related knowledge from the surface during their raids. Nonetheless, certain items had been developed by the drow, or based on magic from before the  ,  and most of those items were created to be only usable by drow, due to their paranoia. \n The drow loved magical items of any kind, and all powerful families gave some enchanted items to those who served them. The   was a notorious example, although   were also important to the drow houses and granted special powers like, sometimes,  . \n Drow had an aptitude for  ,  elegantly limning runes in black paste,  , or inlay. There were three categories of drow runes and glyphs: the  , used by the most powerful drow to defend their houses and treasures, the  , used to guard places with drow traffic but no permanent population, and the  , only found in sacred sites of  .  Runes could be enchanted with a    ,  and drow   could create unique ones for locations of importance. \n Drow priestesses and wizards often created magical scrolls to give their warriors an edge during their patrols. Overall, the drow used scrolls more often than surface races and were also known to create unique ones. \n Drow practitioners of path magic organized their spells in the so-called Path of the Drow, also known as Lolth's Road, or the Spider Road. It was considered a lost path, i.e. generally unknown to other races. \n While the drow misunderstood psionics and distrusted its practioners, as in most societies, the dark elves were different in that their extensive dealings with duergar and illithids made them more familiar and somewhat more excepting of it. Though their leaders were skeptical of it, working to ensure it didn't threaten them, they often saw it as a useful and unexpected tool in their arsenal. ;\n Like any other civilization, the drow had craftsmen, farmers, and businesses but these were undercut by the priestesses of   and the nature of their society. Not only did Lolth's chosen purposefully undermine opportunities for growth to retain their grip on power (too much change too quickly risked giving the lower class a dangerous taste of freedom), but while supposedly expected to do so, they had the authority to take items from businesses without paying. If a priestess particularly liked the products, this could cause a business to go bankrupt despite the owners' efforts, leaving the destitute workers with no choice but to enter a contract that essentially made them slaves to the priestess. \n In general, drow society didn\u2019t have unemployment or homelessness issues, as those who fell in either or both categories were naturally dealt with. This could mean that they suffered indiscriminate violence, were used in murderous sport by drow nobles, or were simply put to work as slaves. Many drow signed up into the military because the risk of a violent death there was lower than as an unemployed or homeless individual. The constant demand for soldiers, no matter the level of skill, allowed such course of action. \n The second greatest power group inside a given drow city were the merchant clans,  whose success was important for the survival of the drow race.  The clans were among the primary mercantile organizations in the Underdark, and their presence was common along its trade routes.  Contrary to the Houses, merchant clans were run by male drow, since females considered interaction with outsiders to be too demeaning and dangerous for them. Outside the environment of the drow cities, merchant clans and noble Houses openly fought each other. \n Merchant clans had some variation, but often had a few rules in common. The lowest ranking members, almost exclusively non-drow, were called \"assets\", and made up the labor and military force of the organization. Male drow of merchant clans generally had no inhibitions when it came to interacting with other races, including surface-dwellers, because they knew that there was no chance of advancement within their society for them. In fact, many of the \"second ring\", as the managers of a merchant clans were called, were non-drow. A council of male wizards, called an \"inner ring\", ruled over the clan. \n Only the most experienced and worldly drow of the merchant clans were capable of forming genuine friendships with the so-called lesser races, including mind flayers or duergars.  \n In typical drow society, where the the concept of inherent value of life did not exist, slavery was an important practice.  All unskilled labor in drow cities was carried out by slaves, and for that reason the slave trade was a booming business. Slaves were not only captured but also bred,  or bought from sellers like the   of  ,  , and the  , and the   from the  . \n The drow didn't see slaves as a valuable commodity, but as a cheaply and easily replaceable tool that they were allowed to treat cruelly and exploit at will.  Slaves, in general, were not allowed to look into the eyes of a drow or to carry weapons without permission (a rule that was mostly enforced when the slave was a gladiator of some kind). \n Given that all unskilled labor in drow cities was carried out by slaves, and that surface dwellers were considered to be the best for that role, surface raids were vital for the maintenance of the economy.  No matter the size, these attacks had the primary objective to capture people, with looting considered a matter of secondary importance. \n Large raid parties, consisting of hundreds of members that sacked entire cities, were rare. Most raids only involved small bands, and started with scouting operations, followed by either open bloodshed or by infiltration to kidnap potential slaves. Sometimes both methods were combined; one drow group could catch the attention of the residents, for example through arson, while another force fulfilled the actual objective of kidnapping people undisturbed. Due to the drow's weakness to sunlight, the attacks usually happened at night and ended before dawn.  To take advantage of even the smallest cracks that constituted an opening to the surface,   were used in these assaults. \n It was common for injured drow to make use of a prosthesis, as craftsmanship in artificial limbs was advanced and easily available. They were made from  , worked as well as the original limbs, and could also be situationally weaponized or equipped with parts functioning as specialized tools. For example, exchanging a hand with a claw or sword for combat was possible. From time to time, non-injured drow used this technology for their body-extensions, like toe-claws to kick-stab their enemies. \n The drow were particularly proficient in designing ways to move and store goods, from trade-containers to harnesses for beasts of burden and mounts. This technology was born out of a high demand for goods that had to be carried to drow cities from distant places, like crabs or fish found in the Underdark, which their patrols carried in so-called \"wet basins\" made of clay, or fruits and other surface-only goods, which they obtained by means of trade and raid.  The drow also developed magic items that helped transportation of both people and goods, like the  , the  , and the  . \n As a general rule, drow had a preference for smooth or cabochon cut gems over faceted ones, and preferred black, blue, and red to other colors. Gems of silvery hues were used as contrast when it couldn't be provided by metal. Gems were usually worked in rings, wristlets, gorgets, belts, pendants, or collars. \n Drow of average wealth wore  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Nobles, powerful  , officers, and priestesses wore other, more prized stones like  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . When it came to the priestesses, the amount, rarity, and variety of gems that they wore was on a higher level than all other drow. Other kinds of gems were often used as currency for trade with non-drow. \n Drow were the most wide-spread and numerous among the Underdark races.  They lived in about forty city-state scattered around the   and  ,  primarily in the latter. Drow were usually only sent in the   as scouting parties, or as some kind of punishment for angering a matron. \n Drow preferred to live in areas that fulfilled certain  . As a result, most of their settlements were found under the  , north and west of  , from the underground of   to the one of  . Their sphere of influence, however, was much larger. \n Some notable drow cities were:\n Drow were a common sight in the  , having some cities, such as  .  The dark elves of this plane spied on the   and occasionally traded information and goods with the various   realms. \n The term \"surface drow\" referred to all individuals who spent less than four consecutive days below the surface in their regular life.  Surface drow had no love for bright light, open sky, and loud noises, and a preference for darkness.  Most surface drow were followers of Vhaeraun, not Lolth,  and the vast majority of Eilistraee's followers were also on the surface.  Among the surface, drow was not a huge problem like in the Underdark. \n A number of them embraced a truly different morality than most of their brethren, either because born on the surface, or because of a decision to abandon the way of Lolth. Some of those who came to the surface from the Underdark had already formed a different morality before leaving, while others had used to live under the Lolthite dogma. Among the latter, certain individuals were haunted by their past deeds, sometimes to the point of being broken by the weight of their horrible actions (even becoming a danger due to their mental instability), while others were truly unapologetic about their behavior in the Underdark, and pushed all responsibility on the necessity of it. \n Many drow on the surface were actually spies still loyal to Lolth, sent to infiltrate the enemy and gather information for their matrons. However, the more time a drow spent among its enemies, the higher the risk that drow would defect in some way. In some cases this was to undermine a rival house by perpetuating false information, while others began sympathizing with their foes, even to the point of believing they were undeserving of the hate they received and the violence their kin would inflict on them. \n Surface drow, while ignored by others, were attractive to the merchant clans, for they represented a contact to the surface for trade. For example, some surface drow managed to become traders who traded with  ,  ,  ,  , or  .  That said, the majority of surface drow lived as hermits or found employment in rather unsavory areas of expertise where their heritage was an actual advantage, like adventurer companies or assassins' guilds. \n Initial exposure to sunlight was dangerous for a drow and cause of heavy sunburns. Even after getting used to the sunlight, drow had a strong tendency to cover their skin and head when exposed. \n Drow eyes were sensitive to heat, possessing   up to a range of 120\u202ffeet  (37\u202fmeters). Formal education or much practice was needed to \"read\" heat hues, as the drow had no innate ability to discern the meaning of the various patterns from birth. Cold objects appeared grey, while heat was seen, in ascending order of intensity, as blue, purple, red, and warm yellow.  They also had   up to the same range, but not the   characteristic of other elves.  It took a drow about ten years of exposure for them to get used to the sunlight and to use their infravision and normal vision simultaneously. \n Drow had excellent hearing, a trait developed by necessity given the paramount importance of foreseeing rock shifts, collapses, and other hazards in the  . It was also the primary means by which they found water, by listening to the dripping sound it made. They had long, slender fingers and a keen tactile sense, to the point of being able to read subtle markings on stone as if they were Braille. On the other hand, drow had a  -like sense of smell, far less keen than in the other Underdark races and than their other senses. Smells were dulled in the Underdark, and the ubiquitous smell of damp rocks and the fungi-riddled air of their natural environment, combined with the strong incenses and the scent of slaves in the drow cities, made it difficult to develop a keen olfactory sense. \n In contrast to creatures such as dwarves or deep gnomes, who had a deep, intutive sense of stone and subterranean conditions, the drow race's specialty laid in the   of stone, the cutting and shaping of rock into smooth-flowing forms. About 70% of drow had an intuitive understanding of how fortifications or waterworks were constructed, operated, circumvented, and controlled, an innate \"feeling\" that extended to works made by other races.  They could recognize   items by holding them,  and if given a piece of Underdark-metal, or a cut or worn gem, drow could typically identify it. Upon finding a vein, like dwarves or deep gnomes, they had a sense of its direction, richness, and dimensions.  \n Drow liked to eat live animals because they believed the meat had a better flavor. \n Like all elves, drow required no sleep, instead entering a meditative trance while retaining full awareness of their surroundings. The trance lasted around four hours, and provided the same benefits as a member of any other race having a full period of rest. \n However, while elves relived parts of their memories, including those of past lives, during their trances, drow normally experienced nothing, save for the occasional dream (which they tried to interpret by looking for signs from Lolth). The fact that drow didn't relive memories of past lives during their trances was viewed as an indication that, unlike the elves, their souls didn't reincarnate. \n The drow were believed to be more fecund than other elves,  though in truth, they simply had a higher readiness to birth as many children as possible during their lifespan.  For example, in the average Lolthite society, a female drow with an active career under her belt gave birth to about ten children before she lost the ability to birth more.  \n Drow lifespans were comparable to the rest of the elven race (and therefore far surpassed those of humans),  but the constant strife of their society kept their numbers low,  dropping their actual rate of population growth to  -like levels.  Provided they did not meet a premature and violent end, a drow's natural lifespan was about 750 years.  They started to show signs of aging at around 600 years,  and rarely lived past their seventh century, with about 94% of natural deaths occurring before 800 years of age. \n Drow who could afford a lifestyle that spared them hardships, like matron mothers, could live more than 1000 years (though, by that point, they would be withered by age). Lolth's magic could maintain a matron's life for thousands of years, and this was considered a clear sign of favor from the goddess. \n There were a number of races and creatures that were in some ways related to the drow.\n Some races were not related to the drow because they were born from them but because they were transformed from drow.\n The history of the drow is filled with confusion and uncertainties. Many fanatical drow told lies and fabrications about their own history to serve the ends of the noble Houses and of the faiths. \n At times, pieces of history were entirely deleted from the records. It happened to fallen noble Houses, as all information about them was erased,  to deities, as the matron mothers tried to hide all records of Eilistraee's existence,  and even to individual drow. For example, when a  , a   of   who served as a spy in Lolth's church, was found out, any information about the traitor was literally extinguished from historical records, as if that person never existed in the first place,  and by four generations the fabrication was accepted as \"fact\". \n The drow descended from the dark elves of  , the first and one of the most powerful elven nations, and, in minor part, from the survivors of  .  One might imagine that the drow would constantly boast about this heritage, but the truth was that they didn't appreciate being reminded of their origins, for it also reminded them of their deep fall from power.  An exception was the  , whose goal was to elevate the Ilythiiri to their former glory. \n On the other hand, the drow remembered their origins because their feud with the elves was based on history. They believed to have been punished by the Seldarine for their triumph in the Fourth  , and used this as a justification for their entitlement to exact vengeance on the other elves and their gods. \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow"},

As agents of a divine authority, clerics were empowered both by ritual training  and their god's particular favor. Relatively rare, clerics inspired both reverence and terror, depending on their aims and who they served. \n Perhaps the best known \u2014 and most infamous \u2014 cleric on   was   before his ascension to  . Other well-known clerics were  , a   of  , and  , one of the   and a cleric of  .\n Religion was deeply important to the majority of people on Toril, who felt that the gods were a very real and active presence in their lives, something that was not very far from the truth. For this reason, serving the gods was something that most people did as just a regular part of their lives.  Clerics were elite agents of gods, empowered beyond the capabilities of regular priests  and sworn to follow and obey the tenets of their religion in ways that the average mortal couldn't.  Some clerics served   or even  , offering foul sacrifices in exchange for a portion of the fiend's might,  but the majority remained servants of the truly divine. Clerics had to be close to the alignment of their patron, usually within one step of the deity's alignment or less. \n Gods were as varying as people and, as a result, so were their divine agents, such as clerics, who might be good or evil, lawful or chaotic, dependent on who they worshiped and why. Good clerics healed and protected, helping those in need while evil clerics terrorized and destroyed, increasing the power of their deity and themselves. Generally, non-evil clerics were more common, since good or neutral deities tended to attract more worshipers than evil ones did. However, some evil gods, such as  , were popular in their own right, with a large legion of followers and clerics willing to do their bidding. Similarly, though many clerics belonged to orderly and structured churches, chaotic gods had clerical servants as well. \n Relatively few priests became wandering clerics, leaving for adventure only if they felt compelled to do so for their god,  perhaps out of a desire to spread their deity's works or by order of their superiors and the church hierarchy. A few clerics took on the adventuring lifestyle for more mundane reasons.  Regardless of motivation, clerics were highly valued companions, serving as healers and occasional leaders to their compatriots. Additionally, clerics may have been specialized in ways, based on the deity they worship, that put them on agreeable terms with other adventurers.  The most active clerics were typically   or  , though  ,  , and   clerics were also relatively common. \n Nearly all clerics were ordained members of a religious organization of some kind, though a few operated more independently and even those who were bound to a hierarchy did not necessarily answer to a direct superior. Most clerics made their career choice relatively early in life, though some were compelled to service unwillingly by their god.  Churches were often, but not always, tied to a specific god, though few gods presided over more than one church at once, some of which warred with one another over differing interpretations of their god's (or pantheon's) dogma.  Rarely could self-taught clerics who had never interacted with a mentor and did not belong to any formal religious organization be found adventuring or spreading their faith in a particular divine being. \n A cleric's   could be used to control or even destroy the  . Clerics commonly used   or  ,  , simple weapons, and   as their chief tools while adventuring.  Many clerics were also skilled in the use of  .  Clerics augmented these  , also known as \"prayers,\"  through   of their deity that they wore or carried with them.  Clerics were also experts in casting  , enhanced spells that require an incredible amount of time and preparation to use but which often had dramatic effects.  Others might instead have chosen to be trained in preparing   recipes. \n Clerics could also learn to directly access the channel the divinity of their deity through their body.  This power manifested itself in several ways, the most common of which was the ability to  , repelling or even destroying the  .  A few clerics learned instead to control the undead, particularly those of an evil nature.  Some clerics may have learned to channel divinity based on their   or the nature of the deity they worshiped.  Clerics of   and  , for example, had access to wildly different ways to channel their deity's divinity. \n Sufficiently experienced clerics could even invoke their deity's intervention directly, without using Channel Divinity. If successfully petitioned, the deity's aid could come in one of several forms, from a spell to something more unusual. Such calls for aid, however, were difficult to make and the gods were disinclined to respond much more often than once a  . \n Some clerics were powerful healers thanks to special training and the blessings of their gods, both of which increased the potency of the curative prayers available to them. Many clerics were capable of casting the   prayer, while more experienced clerics were often capable of much more.  Some clerics were also trained in transforming other prayers into powers of healing or, if the cleric worshiped a non-good god, into spells of   power. \n Some clerics had additional abilities less common among their compatriots. Several clerics learned, in addition to the   ritual known to many of them, the ritual of  , which allowed a cleric to convert their prayers into healing energy. A fewer number of clerics, generally evil in alignment, learned instead to convert this stored energy into   for the purpose of harming enemies. \n Many clerics were also fluent in   or  , as well as their related dialects. \n In addition to the abilities common to all clerics, clerics also could access a number of powers through aspects of their god's portfolio known as  . At the beginning of their career, a cleric chose one  - or occasionally two  - of the domains associated with their patron deity, giving them access to a number of unique prayers and abilities. These domains allowed clerics to prepare   each day from a list particular to that domain, in addition to their more general prayers. \n Each domain also had a number of other benefits associated with it. For example, the   allowed its clerics to return an enemy attack with thunderous or electrical power.  Similarly, the   made clerics more adept at casting healing prayers. \n While not every cleric specialized in a particular domain, most did.  Some of the most commonly accessed domains are listed below.\n Used commonly by worshipers of scholarly deities such   or  , the   attracted those who believed learning was an end unto itself. Some deities presiding over the Knowledge domain were secretive and jealously guarded what they and their followers knew, while others promoted the spread of knowledge through the construction of libraries and universities. Other gods, like  , were more interested in the practical application of knowledge, rather than its research and discovery. \n Clerics adhering to the Knowledge domain gained a number of abilities from their training. Some of these new skills were relatively mundane, such as learning another language or two. Others were considerably more powerful though, such as the ability to mentally \"read\" an object and to discover the details of its recent past. \n The favorite of healers or those active in the fight against undeath, the Life domain was presided over by a number of diverse powers, from agricultural deities such as   to the sun god   to deities of healing like  . The Life domain, which encompassed both healing and radiant-powered prayers, was fueled by the power of  , found in the  . As a general rule, non-evil deities preferred this domain to evil ones. \n The Life domain provided a number of unique abilities to its practitioners, encompassing both manifestations of positive energy. Among the healing abilities gained by Life domain clerics was the   ability, a form of channeling divinity that allowed the caster to restore a severely wounded creature up to roughly half of its peak potential. In addition, experienced Life domain clerics obtained the ability to infuse their weapons with radiant energy drawn from the Positive Energy Plane. \n Gods of light such as   or   presided over this domain, which represented ideals such as renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty.  Some   gods like   were patrons of the arts, while others, such as   were stalwarts of duty, devoted to the expulsion of lies and the banishment of darkness.  The Light domain was generally favored by non-evil deities. \n The abilities of Light domain clerics were generally light or fire-flavored. Among the most basic of these skills gathered was the    . Additionally, extremely experienced clerics specializing in the Light domain could generate an aura of bright light that lasted for up to a minute, shining into a space of up to 90\u202fft  (27\u202fm) in radius. They were also able to enhance any spells cast in the area using fire or radiant power. \n While many priests who served nature deities like   or   were  , clerics were also numbered among their servants. Many clerics who did venerate the gods of the wilderness made use of the  , which granted them some semblance of control over wild animals and plants alike. Whereas their druid compatriots were secretive and reclusive by inclination, clerics in the service of nature took a more active role, championing the cause of their gods by hunting evil monsters, blessing harvests, or bringing a famine upon their enemies. \n Clerics specializing in the Nature domain had a number of abilities to claim as their own. One such ability was their ability to calm animals or plants, reducing their hostility for a period of up to a minute or so. With additional training, Nature domain clerics could learn even to control such creatures, commanding them to do as they wish. \n The Tempest domain was the abode of a diverse array of gods, from storm gods like   to ocean gods like  . What all of these gods held in common was a violent temperament and a penchant for inspiring fear. Clerics who served these gods were much the same, wielding their powers to strike terror into the faithful, either to force the wicked back to righteousness or in order to compel ritual offerings in exchange for safety. \n The abilities granted by Tempest domain deities to their clerics were destructive by their very nature. One such boon was the   that could be invoked by channeling their deities' divinity, which increased the deadliness of electrical or sonic attacks cast by the cleric. In addition to such deadly powers, the most experienced Tempest domain clerics were also capable of flying, so long as they were neither indoors or underground. \n Not all clerics were inclined to seriousness or self-righteous zeal. The clerics who served gods of the   - a lot which includes  ,  , and   - were mischievous troublemakers by their very nature, more akin to a   than a   by temperament. Clerics of this domain mocked the powerful and defied tradition, disrupting \"polite society\" wherever they went. Some were freedom-fighters, some were criminals, and others were just pranksters. Whatever their specific method, these clerics preferred to challenge, rather than accept, the conventional order of things.  \n Because Trickery domain clerics were more inclined to deception and misdirection than direct conflict, their abilities similarly diverged from some of the more martial characteristics of other priests. For example, many of the spells wielded by such clerics were   or  , rather than direct attacks. Likewise, Trickery domain clerics could channel their deities' divinity in a form known as  , which allowed them to create one or more phantasmal copies of themselves, for the purpose of distraction or remote spellcasting. \n War was a common part of mortal life and so it should come as little surprise that there were many clerics who devoted themselves to the gods of war. The nature of such gods varied somewhat, from champions of honor like   to pillars of destruction like  , but they all held in common an interest in the act of fighting, watching over those in battle who offered them tribute. Clerics specializing in the   served these deities. \n As might be expected, the abilities of War domain clerics enhanced such priests' ability to fight on the front-line. Early on, War domain clerics were trained in the use of heavy armor and martial weapons, giving them additional protection and making them deadlier foes. With more experience, War domain clerics could also attack foes with an uncanny degree of precision. \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cleric"},

Physically, they were most distinguished by their horns, which protruded from the sides of their heads and wrapped around, projecting forward. A large frill adorned the upper part of the neck.

They were cunning creatures who lived to inspire fear and rule by intimidation. The black, glossy scales of black dragons added to their camouflage within swamp lands. They preferred to ambush their targets, using darkness or water as their cover. They were excellent swimmers and often made their lairs in submerged caves or underground chambers near swamps or murky ponds. Their lairs always had two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp or pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth. \n Female dragons took the lead when it came to breeding, choosing their mate largely based on the size of the hoard of prospective males. Because of this, male black dragons would often brag about their accumulated wealth to communicative creatures or others of their own kind, in the hopes that rumors of their hoard would spread to any females in the area that were looking to mate. When two or more females selected the same male as their partner, they would fight for dominance high in the air above the lair of the male, allowing him to gaze upon his future mate's victory in admiration. \n Black dragons were not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them personally. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while growing, which helped protect the dragon as well.  Black dragons would only protect their young so long as that responsibility didn't threaten their own life. If they had to choose between saving their own life or those of their clutch or spawn, they would most certainly choose the former; though they would assuredly seek revenge afterwards. \n A black dragon's diet consisted of fish, mollusks, aquatic critters and some red meat from terrestrial animals. \n The skies over the southwestern   and southern   have been the source of multiple sightings of black dragons.

Permanently injured or aging goliaths often sought death in battle rather than succumb to an existence where they could not excel. \n Trust and honor were the key aspects of most goliaths.  This tradition of honor and trust meant that goliaths tended to be good overall. This combined with their competitive nature often led goliaths to valorous heroics.  Goliaths were also notably daring and fearless. Feats of physical strength and agility, like jumping chasms or climbing cliffs, held no fear for goliaths.  Goliaths were naturally curious beings and loved to explore. \n Complacency was a trait that goliaths loathed and as a result they never took anything for granted. Even goliaths with magical advantages would continue to train their physical prowess in case they ever lost their power. \n Goliath tribes only went to war as a final option, preferring to move away from unsafe lands. They did not do this out of fear or cowardice, instead they were aware that loss of life in their tribe was undesirable and had long-term consequences. \n If forced to go to war, however, a tribe would do so without fear. Circumstances that might force a tribe included being cornered or having members of their tribe kidnapped. Once weapons were distributed and war-captains were chosen, a goliath tribe could quickly become a very capable war-band. Goliaths were always at the peak of their physical condition and their fine-tuned hunting skills made them competent warriors at a moment's notice. \n All adult goliaths (regardless of sex) fought in times of war. Only children and infants were expected not to fight. \n  and   were favored by goliaths as they already had naturally durable bodies and did not like to restrict their movement. Goliaths often used large two-handed weapons to make the most of their considerable strength. \n Goliaths often employed   tactics in battle, owing to their upbringing as hunters. Fair-play was also integral to goliath fights. As long as they were fairly sure they could still win, goliaths would even handicap themselves to give their opponents a fair chance. For example, if a goliath disarmed their opponent, they would throw aside their own weapon and continue the fight with their fists. \n As with their recreational sports, goliaths seriously frowned upon \"cheating\" in battle. Finishing off a fallen foe, taking hostages, and attacking civilians were considered distasteful and unfair. \n Sometimes slavers were known to kidnap goliath infants and raise them as brutal gladiators. \n Goliath society's key focus was competitiveness.  Their society also held equality and fairness in high regard. \n Goliaths lived in small tribes that numbered between forty and sixty goliaths. This was usually made up of three to five extended families. Most goliaths lived in the same tribe their entire life. On rare occasions, a tribe that got too large would split into smaller tribes or smaller tribes would merge together. \n Goliath tribes had a number of key roles that were filled by the most capable members. Summaries of these roles are included below:\n Tribe chieftains only maintained power as long as they could prove they were suitable for that role. As a result, leadership constantly changed.  New leaders were chosen by contests. Any goliath could challenge the chieftain in an attempt to replace them. If this happened, the chieftain and the challenger competed in three tasks. The challenger had to win all three to become the new chieftain. The old chieftain would then leave the tribe permanently.  Due to the fact that few goliaths lived to old age, goliath tribes relied on innate wisdom in their leaders rather than wisdom gained from years of experience. \n The competitive nature of goliaths meant that the attitude and achievements of one would quickly inspire the whole tribe. Individuals within tribes would constantly be trying to outdo each other's good deeds. This meant that nearby settlements often stereotyped goliaths as a heroic and good people. \n Goliath tribes were not large or permanent as the mountain terrain didn't allow for such settlements. Temporary villages would be set up then disassembled and relocated every month or so. \n Many of the goliath homelands were in the mountain ranges in  . The  ,   ,  , and   were known to have goliath tribes.  Mountain ranges in and around   and northern   (particularly  , where they might have competed with   for resources) may also have been home to goliath populations. \n The   in the   was home to two rival goliath clans who fiercely competed for territory and resources: the   from   and the   from  . \n Goliaths were not afraid to mix with other cultures or travel. By the late 15th century  , small numbers of goliath sellswords could be found as far away as the  .    was home to a small number of goliaths. \n Although goliaths had no written laws or codes, there were a number of unspoken rules that were commonly followed by most goliath tribes, discouraging theft and cheating. The greatest rule was obedience to the chieftain and captains. \n Because they were nomadic tribes who shared belongings or traded goods rather than use gold, conventional punishments like imprisonment or fining were not possible. Instead, tribes often employed the following punishments: \n Goliaths who broke the shunning risked being shunned themselves. This was a serious transgression, as it threatened goliath society itself. \n It was common for a goliath who knew they had failed their tribe to leave the tribe of their own accord, rather than force the tribe into the awkward position of exiling them. Some stubborn goliaths however had to be forced into exile. \n Several goliaths playing a game of Goat-Ball. The cultures and traditions of goliath tribes varied from tribe to tribe and region to region but a number of traits were common across several tribes. \n Goliaths had little empathy or pity for adults who couldn't take care of themselves but they would treat and take care of the injured and sick. Permanently injured goliaths were still expected to contribute in every way that they could. \n Arts and crafting in goliath culture were limited by the resources they had at hand in the mountains. As a result, goliaths were skilled in crafts like  ,  , stitching, creating simple pottery, bone-carving, and painting. \n Goliath art was often colorful and expressive. Art was one of the few things that goliaths understood to be non-competitive; they fully appreciated that art couldn't have a winner. Goliaths believed that art should be used to show people something they couldn't see in the real world. Goliaths decorated their tents, caves,  , and clothes with abstract designs (often jagged, parallel lines and symbols that had astronomical significance). \n The language of the goliaths was   and it was spoken exclusively for thousands of years. The language had only thirteen phonetic elements and was only ever spoken. \n Gol-Kaa was spoken in the active voice (\u201cKulagath climbed the mountain\u201d) almost exclusively. It was grammatically torturous to use passive voice (\u201cthe mountain was climbed by Kulagath\u201d).\n After interacting with dwarves and other races, the goliaths began to learn languages like  ,    and  . Those tribes that learnt the written scripts of the dwarven language  began to transcribing their oral traditions and history into carvings, cave paintings and even books.  By   many goliaths could speak, read and write in common and giant. \n Goliath names were made up of three parts; a first name assigned by the individual's parents, an honorific middle name chosen by the tribe's chief, and a family or clan name. The first name was often just one or two syllables. The honorific name assigned could change at the whim of the chief depending on particular achievements or failures. Exiled goliaths tended to carry middle names like \"solitary\" or \"Kinless\". The last name was often five or six syllables and always ended in a vowel. \n Most goliath tribes revered nature and the   forces. Goliath   were known as \"skywatchers\"  or \"sunspeakers\" . They also worshiped a pantheon of six deities: \n Two teams of goliaths playing goat-ball. Considering their competitive nature, it's not surprising that sports were often played by goliaths to improve their physical skills and pass time. Simple games included climbing, sprinting, and wrestling. \n Other games that were popular amongst many tribes included:\n Goliaths inspecting   weaponry. Goliaths were friendly to anyone who didn't threaten their tribe, but wouldn't wait around for travelers who couldn't keep up with them. \n Goliaths were particularly fond of   and had great respect for dwarven blacksmiths. Some goliaths would even venture into mountain tunnels to seek out dwarves to trade with. \n    or   were known to sometimes work together with goliath tribes in hunts. Both the humans and goliaths could mutually benefit from these temporary alliances. \n Goliaths often referred to   as their \"cousins\". The two races maintained a friendly rivalry. \n  were somewhat intimidating to goliaths, owing to their long lifespans. Goliaths often struggled with the idea that creatures existed that were old enough to have known their great-grandparents and ancestors. \n Although they had no particular hatred of  ,  , or  , goliaths were wary of them. This was mostly due to the stories that they heard from passing travelers about the trouble they caused. \n Attitudes towards   varied. Some tribes traded with giants. Giant weapons were not as well crafted as dwarven ones, but they were a far more suitable size. Some giants, however, would try and make goliaths into slaves. This led to conflicts and goliaths being wary of giants. \n Although   particularly hated goliaths,  it's unclear if the feeling was mutual.\n Goliaths who ventured out of their tribes would often find issue with the class divisions found in other societies. Goliaths struggled with the idea that an incompetent king could rule over hard-working peasants. These opinions were often shared and goliaths would openly mock incapable leaders or rich nobleman who relied on social structures to maintain their power. \n It's unclear how old the goliath race was or where they originally came from, but it was commonly believed that they were somehow related to   or earth genasi.  Another origin story claimed that the first goliaths were     who sought answers from their gods. These individuals climbed the   mountain range to seek parley with their gods. It was said that the journey to the peaks turned the seekers into the first goliaths.  The story the goliaths told was that they were created by Kavaki from gems that he found growing on a bush that grew on the highest peak. \n In the  , a group of goliath hunters from   were part of an alliance that successfully defeated the    . \n As of  , some thirty-six goliath outcasts lived in  , in  . They lived in relative harmony with the various other races that had taken up refuge in the underground village. \n By  , many of the mountain-dwelling goliath tribes had become even more isolated, thanks to the   lowlands. The tribes stayed in the safety of their mountain tops and few travelers ventured across the dangerous lowlands. \n \n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n    \u2022   \u2022   \u2022     \u2022   \u2022  \n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022  \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Goliath"},

Yet, despite this relief, it also harbored a deep-seated resentment toward being forcibly conjured.

Elves tended to be fair and beautiful by human standards and graceful, though they were often frail as well.  Elves stood on average 5\u20324\u2033\u20126\u20320\u2033 (1.6\u20121.8\u202fm) and weighed 130\u2012170\u202flb (59\u201277\u202fkg). Usually, true elves were a naturally slender and athletic race.  Elves had a similar range of complexions to  , with wood elves typically coppery or pale skinned and wild elves having darker pigmentation. Often, elven hair was dark, either brown or black, with copper red or blond hair also found amongst wood elves,  although orange or even green hues were not completely unheard of.  Elven eyes were commonly brown, hazel, or an emerald green.  Elves had pointed ears and had no hair on their body save eyebrows, eyelashes, and scalp hair. \n Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to. \n Elves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary. \n Elves were a relaxed people, with a degree of patience and detachment granted to them by their long lifespans. Elves were not easily excited and lack the greed that sometimes characterized other races. Most elves were unconcerned with the events that only affected the short-term and were likewise slow to make friends or enemies since time for them was measured in centuries, not decades. Focused on whatever they applied themselves to, elves ignored the slight but rarely forgot the serious. \n Because of their long lifespan, most elves had a patience uncommon to other humanoids. Tel-quessir viewed the lives and concerns of younger races as fleeting and took less joy in the short-term victories that other races had to content themselves with. Instead, elves took pleasure in things that had more endurance, such as the arts or the honing of one's skills. \n Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other   races. They tended to be supremely aware of their surroundings, with more potent senses of sight and sound than humans. All Tel-quessir had the ability to see in low light conditions unhampered,  though drow also possessed the ability to see in the dark.  Elves were also agile, dexterous creatures and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Additionally, elves were accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids. \n Elves were universally long-lived, achieving what they consider adulthood at 110 years of age and living for up to 700 and more years thereafter.   However, wood and wild elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, but did not display many signs of ageing past adulthood, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening. Most of these elves remained healthy and full of life up until their death, which was usually well over two centuries. \n Many elves did not sleep, instead finding their rest in a meditative state called   or \"trance\", which was as restful as true sleep but left them aware of their surroundings. In this state, they achieved the same results as a human might through sleeping in roughly two thirds the time. Elves able to trance were also often resistant to the effects of supernatural powers such as  , since they did not themselves sleep but instead rested in a semi-aware state. \n Elves had an affinity for freedom more than anything else, preferring the way of unrestricted liberty to the restraints of civilized law and order. Liberty, both of one's self and of others, tended to be the greatest virtue in elven cultures. This love for freedom was often tempered by a good and generous nature, though not always.  Drow in particular stood out as an example of evil amongst the Tel-quessir. \n Elven governments tended to be very loosely organized, with small groups of elves accepting the legitimacy of a respected noble, who in turn acknowledged the authority of a monarchical king.  As of the 14  century  , many moon, sun, and wood elven rulers paid their respects to the  , presided over by Queen   in Evermeet. \n Elves tended to take up the  's lifestyle for a number of reasons. Some did so out of, more than anything, boredom or a sense of wanderlust that drove them to explore beyond the boundaries of their homelands. They did not like being tied down and most often pursued careers that lent themselves well to adventuring. Some elves enjoyed adventuring as a way to demonstrate their own skill, such as with a bow or sword, while others did so in order to help others. \n Elves did not distinguish between males and females  and so did not discriminate based on  . Males and females were treated equally in all areas, neither was excluded from anything, and they achieved power and fame in equal measure, apart from a tendency for more women in positions of authority, with a historically greater number of queens than kings. Unlike some other societies, they understood the value and potential of women. \n \"Tel-quessir\" was the elven word for \"the people.\" Likewise, \"N-Tel-Quess\" was the elven word for \"not people\" and was used to refer to races outside of the Tel-quessir. This often gave other races the impression that elves were elitist, racist, and condescending to other races, but most simply saw these as words with no hidden meaning or agenda. \n Although the other races sometimes believed elves to be arrogant and condescending, they didn't hold any particular hatred for any races as a whole, though individual races may have had particular attitudes. The harshest racial conflict for the elves was actually often within, given the long-standing feud between the drow and the other Tel-quessir races. Elves could seem distant and unfriendly because many of the other races, such as humans and halflings, had a much shorter lifespan. It was easier for an elf to avoid contact with these races, rather than befriend individuals who lived only a small fraction of the elven life. \n  and elves generally had a different problem in forming relationships. Dwarves favored hard work whereas elves generally enjoyed relaxation. Dwarves enjoyed carving homes from the rock and engineering unswerving straight lines, while elves preferred more natural, flowing shapes. Dwarves and elves could form strong bonds of friendship, but only when both agreed to overlook each other's differences. \n  and elves generally got along well thanks to their mutual love of life, combined with the gnomes' love of fine art and   magic. On the other hand,   and elves shared only a lukewarm relationship. The elven habit of eating sparingly was not welcomed in halfling society, and elves sometimes deemed a halfling's curiosity as childlike and troublesome. \n Elves regarded   with both fear and respect. Humans grasped magic and adapted to many situations incredibly fast from an elven perspective, but they were wary of the human tendency to claim lands as their own, often regarding them as greedy. It was quite possible for strong friendships to develop between humans and elves, but it was equally possible that hostilities might arise. \n Elves tended to favor woodlands over other terrains, though exceptions existed. Most elven communities were relatively small in size, around a few hundred in number, and blended easily into the natural landscape. These communities were usually very well isolated and as a result contact between elves and outsiders was usually a matter of deliberate contact rather than accidental. \n Wood and wild elves were usually found in small tribes throughout the forests of Toril, as well as on windswept plains and in mountain vales. They preferred these secluded places of nature to the cities and nations of the civilized world, living in harmony with their natural surroundings. Cautious and cunning warriors, particularly of the bow, elves secured these homelands through guile and tactics. \n Elves who lived among humans, of whom there were many, tended to take on roles that favored the arts, such as minstrels, artists, or sages. Many were also valued as martial instructors, given the elven races' well-known skills with both the   and the  . \n Elves were typically omnivorous, like humans, but tended to eat very little meat. This was not so much out of concern for the animal as an effort to make as little of an impact on the natural world as possible, with elves believing that the consumption of vegetation had a lesser impact on natural harmony. Additionally, this partially came from many elven cultures' traditions of nomadic life, which required food to be easily preservable. \n There were at least nine different subraces  and at least three different sub-categories of elves. \n Many elves were quite proud of their particular sub-race. It was said that to insult a moon elf, call him a gray elf. To insult a sun elf, call him a moon elf. \n Legends told that the Tel-quessir were born out of the first divine blood shed by Corellon in the deity's battles against the god  . \n The elves created directly from Corellon were much like the god, and far more powerful than modern elves, as they retained their creator's innate ability for shapeshifting and change. As some of them earned Corellon's favor they became the first members of the elven pantheon, including the elf who would go on to become the Spider Queen, Lolth. \n The   opened   from   to      , allowing the first elves to cross over and settle, as part of an effort to undermine the power of the  . The green elves continued to live contentedly as small, scattered tribes and worshiped the   (rather than the then-unknown Seldarine). However, one tribe, the  , negotiated with the dragons and established a small southern kingdom based around their capital,  , which stood as a glorious example of elven culture for millennia to come. \n   , following the fall of   in the world of  , a small band of gold elves led by Prince  , together with a single silver elf,  , searched for a new home. A   showed them the world of Toril and the gold elf priestess   died to open a   there that allowed the elven refugees of Tintageer through. They settled on a continent they named  , meaning \"the One Land\". They mixed with the existing green elves and gave rise to the sun elves, while the descendants of Sharlario Moonflower became known as the moon elves. \n Elves reigned on Toril in relative peace until  , when the sun elf nation of   invaded the dark elf and green elf nation of  , starting the first of the five  , which lasted for a total of 3000 years. \n At the end of the Fourth Crown War, the dark elf Ilythiiri were banished to the      ,  becoming the drow. Finally, the Fifth Crown War that followed resolved matters, ending the conflicts. The Tel-quessir remained at peace with each other (with, of course the exception of the drow). \n The green elves suffered many defeats in the Crown Wars and by the end of the conflict had lost all of their former territory.  Withdrawing into the wilderness, the green elves gradually diverged from the high elves.  The green elves who remained in isolation became the wild elves and lost their taste for civilization and nation-building, becoming nomadic wanderers.  Others became the first of the wood elves. \n The wood elves, unlike the wild elves, continued to build civilizations, though on a smaller scale. In the eastern  , the wood elves founded the kingdom of  , a contemporary and ally of  . \n For many millennia, thousands of Tel-quessir, particularly moon elves and sun elves, left Faer\u00fbn for the isle of Evermeet in a long migration known as  . However, by   most of the Tel-quessir who desired to leave had already done so, as remarked upon by   of  , and in fact, the Retreat began a gradual reversal, with many who had left or their children returned to the continent. \n The human scholar   wrote a book about elves based on the studies conducted by the academic minds of  , entitled  . \n \n    article at the  , a wiki for the   campaign setting. \n    article at the  , a wiki for the   campaign setting. \n    article at the  , a wiki for the   campaign setting. \n    article at the  , a wiki for the   campaign setting. \n    article at the  , a wiki for the   campaign setting. \n    article at the  . \n    article at the  , a community wiki for  . \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elf"},

Guardians of the wilderness, druids saw themselves less as masters of the natural order and more as an extension of its will. \n Known for their mysterious nature, druids called the wilderness their home, emulating the ways of wild beasts and other creatures of nature. Believing that nature's health depended on a precarious balance, druids believed that the four elements of the natural world - air, earth, fire, and water - must be prevented from ever gaining advantage over one another, lest the world become dominated by the forces of the  . Likewise, druids believed nature exists outside of civilized conceptions of good, evil,  order or chaos, instead seeking only to maintain a natural state of being which most of the civilized world cannot or will not understand.

However, although druids drew great power from nature, druids, nigh universally, did not see themselves as masters of the wild but rather its servants, much as a   might serve a   or a   his liege.  To a druid, claims of power over the wild was something that only those lacking a proper understanding of nature could profess. The primal power that druids drew upon came to them not through control, but through a spiritual unity with the forces of nature. This distinction was, however, lost on most. \n A druid's symbol. Druids were not the only caretakers of the wilderness, though they were perhaps the best known. Comparable to  , druids were nature's lorekeepers, possessing an enormous degree of knowledge about the inhabitants, locations, and phenomena of  's wildernesses. However, while wizards frequently sought this knowledge for knowledge's own sake (or power's), druids acted in behalf of that which they studied.  Venerating the natural world in a belief system sometimes known as the  , druids valued the pristine wilderness, accepting its cruelty and ugliness along with its wonder and beauty.  As such, while druids rarely acted selfishly, they were nonetheless as likely to be good or evil. \n Druids shared a brotherhood of sorts with all other druids, though it was often a loose association rather than a tightly bound network. Ignoring the artificial boundaries of kings and princes, druids respected and protected all the lands of the world, working with druids from far-away lands as readily as with those whom they know personally.  Communication within this society was aided by the use of a secret language common to all druidic circles, known as  .  Induction into these societies often required knowledge of secret rites and passing dangerous tests, but, once accepted as members, druids were rarely cast out and were allowed to more or less carry on their work in their own way.  Many of these societies were religious in nature and tied to a church of some sort, but not all were, and most druids preferred a degree of distance between civilized churches and the Old Faith.  Of the gods worshiped throughout  , druids found themselves most frequently drawn to  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  , known to many as the  , the first druids. \n Druids were most often  ,  , or  . A few druids also came from other racial backgrounds, such as  ,  ,  , or  , though, generally, druids were uncommon among other races and cultures. Druids as a whole rejected civilization, and as a result sometimes found it difficult to get along with those who embodied its values most distinctively, such as  ,  , or  . Druids instead preferred the company of individuals with like minds, such as  ,  ,   , or  .\n Throughout Faer\u00fbn, druids were most commonly found in regions where pristine wilderness remained undisturbed, such as  ,  , the  , the  , the  , the  , the  , the  , or the  . Before its devastation during the  , the   was another center of druidic activity. While druids were more stereotypically associated with lush forests or jungles, druids could also be found in the care of mountains, deserts, lakes, and the swamps of the world. \n  druids referred to the clerics of all the woodgods, such as Mielikki or Silvanus, as \"treecloaks\". \n There were no druids in the lands of   and  . \n Druids were capable in a number of diverse skills related to the care of the natural world, such as the ability to perceive changes in the environment or interact peaceably with wild beasts. When it came to martial ability, all druids were proficient to some degree in the use of light or medium armor and shields as well as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  , with the notable exception that druids would not use armor or shields forged from metal.  Druids were also able  , adept in the creation of various potions and remedies. \n In addition to their more mundane abilities, druids were also adept in the casting of   born of primal magic,  sometimes known as \"evocations.\"  Druids were also capable of enhancing these spells through a number of magical aids, such as sacred plants like  ,  , or  ,  as well as through constructed implements like   or  .  Like clerics or wizards, druids also knew how to cast  . Additionally, with sufficient experience, the intimate connection between druids and the primal magic they wielded grew so strong as to slow their aging, down to a rate of approximately one tenth that of regular members of their species.  \n Among the more formidable abilities known to druids was a form of shapeshifting known as  . This ability allowed druids to shapeshift into any  ,  including some  , as well as several  , or an indistinct being of feathers, fur, or claws similar to the   spoken of in many druidic legends.  The ability to   came with certain limitations, however. Neophyte druids, were, for example, incapable of assuming a beast capable of extensive swimming, and only with a great deal of training could druids master the form of flying creatures. With practice however, the ability could become quite versatile and experienced druids could learn to cast spells in their beast form. The most experienced druids, known as  , were even capable of shapeshifting at will.  Others learned how to extend their shapeshifting abilities into taking the form of any individual person. \n Other druids had less common abilities. Some druids had, in addition to their   evocations,   that filled some of the functions provided by wild shaping. A few druids were innate experts in the fields of botany and  , identifying various species with perfect accuracy by instinct. As a result, druids were naturally keen to deception by wildlife and fey. Likewise, druids held a natural sense for the safety of drinking water and many were immune to the effects of organic poisons. Several druids were also masters at moving through the wilderness at fast speeds, ignoring the hampering effects of natural hazards such as thorns or briars. With enough training, these druids did not even leave a hint of their movement through the wild. \n In addition to the loose fellowship shared by all druids, druids were divided into more localized organizations known as circles, many of which shared certain common beliefs and abilities.  The term was a nod to the never-ending cycles of natural processes, and emphasized that no creature was superior to another. \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Druid"},

Hunters, scouts, trappers, and assassins, rangers could be found wherever civilization bordered the wilderness. To aid them in their outback treks, rangers were trained in a number of combat techniques, survival skills, and even  . \n Most at home on the edge of civilization, rangers were often hunters, trackers, or some combination of the above, serving as protectors of the civilized world against the wilderness' feral threats.  Stereotyped as wild frontiersmen, rangers were often imagined most at home within dense woodlands. However, this was not true of all rangers and others were more at home within ancient ruins, vast deserts, caverns of the  , or city sewers. What defined a ranger was not so much a bond with nature, though many share such an affinity, but rather their attraction to the unknown and the untamed, most often to protect it but sometimes to subjugate it or emulate its feral power instead,  a drive which inspired rangers in as distant and varying locations as  , the  ,  , the  , the  ,  , the  , the  , the  ,  , or the  .  Undoubtedly useful allies, rangers could also be deadly enemies. When in combat, rangers generally relied on evasive hit-and-run tactics, darting in and out of harm's way. \n A token bearing the symbol of the ranger. The stereotype of the nature-loving ranger was not without merit, however, and many rangers fit the image of cunning hunters and protectors of forests or other wildlands. These rangers saw themselves as guardians against nature's corruption and had a special affinity for   and  , who often shared similar goals. Other rangers were however more mercenary, fighting for personal glory or wealth. As their aspirations differed so did rangers' backgrounds: some came from special military training while others learned under solitary mentors who vested them with lessons on how to survive in places where few of the civilized races cared to tread. Regardless of how they came about their training, all rangers were fairly self-reliant and were as much at home (if not more) in the wild as in a bustling city. \n Rangers were very often motivated by good intentions and many had a well-placed sense of right and wrong.  Many felt it was their calling in life to protect the innocent from monsters, hunting down the wicked wherever they arose to terrorize the weak. Conversely, many rangers had an innate distaste for civilization's creature comforts and the griping it inspired in city folk forced into the wild.  For this latter reason \u2014 and in spite of their often good nature \u2014 rangers rarely got along with  . Rangers with other motives were not uncommon however, and evil rangers who took on the role of a cruel and savage predator were rightly feared. Similarly, while rangers are often chaotic in mindset, others felt an attraction to law or preferred to put themselves on neither \"side\" of law and chaos.  In spite of their general desire for distance from the trappings of civilization, many rangers did align themselves with larger organizations, such as the   or  . Regardless of their moral or ethical outlook, most rangers held themselves accountable to gods of the wilderness, such as   or  . \n Among the civilized   races, rangers were most common among the  , whose culture placed a high value on the natural world and whose natural grace lent itself to a ranger's lifestyle.   in particular were very common, though many   also pursued the way of the two-blade ranger. Among the other races  , due to the race's physical and mental versatility,  and   also gave rise to a fairly large number of rangers.    and  , while less physically and emotionally suited, were often attracted to the ranger's ways as well, half-elves particularly through their elven ancestors and half-orcs out of a desire to get away from the ostracizing confines of civilized society or \u2014 for that matter \u2014   society.   rangers, while rare, were well-respected and commonly known as \"cavers\" among their people.   were, however, both physically well-suited for a ranger's lifestyle  and culturally acclimatized, with the exception of the  .  The rarest of the civilized races to breed rangers were  ,  with an exception for   who often produced rangers to explore the Underdark.  Among the savage races rangers were rarer, though   rangers were not entirely uncommon. \n Trained to be nimble and deadly, rangers were experts in survival wilderness, both on their own and with company. They could move quickly over difficult terrain, evade natural hazards, and disguise their tracks or camouflage themselves to blend in with their surroundings, hiding themselves from their enemies. Although these skills were often very general in nature, every ranger also had their own particular terrain that they knew best, over which they could travel, forage, and track more effectively. Some rangers preferred the wilderness of the surface world, while others dwelt beneath in the caverns of the  . In either case rangers trained their senses to an extremely keen level, allowing them to focus their awareness on the area around them to notice if deadly monsters were nearby. With additional experience, rangers could even perceive unseen enemies as easily as they could visible opponents. \n All rangers were proficient to some degree in   or   and most military-grade weapons as well as  .  Generally, rangers preferred to be lightly protected, as it allowed them more agility and use of their reflexes then heavier armor made possible.  In addition to their general proficiency with martial and simple weapons, rangers specialized in a particular fighting style, such as archery, the use of armor, dueling with a single weapon, or dual wielding.  Rangers who emphasized either style often become members of traditions that further specialized them,  such as the   or the  .  Whatever their particular combat style, rangers were deadly foes, and with a little bit of experience could attack with startling speed. Rangers also honed their combat skills against particular foes whom they had a particular enmity for, such as  ,  , or  , allowing them to better track, hunt, or even communicate with such adversaries. The most experienced rangers could also exploit their knowledge of a foe's weakness to more easily injure or kill them. \n Nearly all rangers were trained in some degree of  , which they used to enhance their own abilities. This magic was often   in nature, drawn from the power of nature itself. Rangers knew few   individually, but could cast them spontaneously, without the need to prepare them. \n While all rangers were expert scouts and trackers, their precise methods differed from one ranger to another. Some of the most common kinds of rangers are listed below.\n Beast Master rangers took their strength from a primal bond with an animal companion, most often a relatively common medium-sized (or smaller) creature such as  ,  ,  ,  , or  , but sometimes something more rare or exotic. Through this bond, the ranger and their beast companion became a formidable team, acting out as extensions of one another. A skilled Beast Master and their companion could carry out flanks and other advanced maneuvers all on their own. As a result, most Beast Master exploits focused on this spirit of coordinated action. In general, Beast Masters emphasized their physical strength for the purpose of athletics and melee combat though agility and wisdom remained important facets of their training. \n As a Beast Master and their companion grew more accustomed to working together, they became capable of several impressive feats. A well-trained beast companion could come rapidly to their ranger's aid, moving with impressive speed to help their ally or attack a shared enemy. The most experienced Beast Masters could also share their magical abilities with their beast companion, applying the effects of spells they cast on both themselves and their friend. \n The strong bond between ranger and beast, which was more like that between two good friends than that found between a master and their slave, sometimes allowed beast companions to develop abilities similar to those of their bonded ranger. Like rangers, beast companions were skilled at fighting in close quarters and they also possessed the capability to act as extensions of their ranger's senses. Beast companions learned beside their rangers, improving in capability as the ranger did. When a Beast Master fell unconscious in combat, a beast companion would often leap to the ranger's defense, carrying on the fight for them. \n The training of a Beast Master did not come without its costs. Though a Beast Master had an edge over other rangers in maneuverability and combat flexibility the effort of coordination meant that they couldn't act as quickly as others, dividing their time and focus between themselves and their companion. Likewise, Beast Masters couldn't take on more than one companion at a time and could only gain a new companion when their old one had either left them or been killed.  New companions were also generally quite difficult to acquire, requiring a ranger to not only locate another suitable animal but to spend 8 hours magically bonding to it.  For this reason, Beast Masters were sometimes trained in the use of the    , which allowed them to recall the fallen spirit of their companion.  Rangers who became exceptionally close to their companions in mind and spirit sometimes became  . \n Professional monster slayers, Hunters dedicated themselves to the eradication of deadly creatures found on the outskirts of civilization. Hunters perfected the specialized hunting techniques used by all rangers to track down and kill specific quarries. The precise target of a Hunter's ire varied significantly, from dread-inspiring   to hordes of orcs. Whatever the threat however, the Hunter was better trained than most to face it. \n Because of the diversity of foes a Hunter might face, their capabilities similarly differed greatly. Some techniques focused on taking down a single, massive foe, like the   technique, which allowed tenacious hunters to wear their enemy down through repeated strikes. Others were better suited to taking on multiple adversaries at once, like the  technique, which Hunter could use to redirect enemy attacks toward the attacker's allies. Additionally, some techniques served a primarily defensive purpose, like  , which gave a Hunter the ability to brace themselves against fear, making it more difficult to panic them. \n A   gloom stalker ranger delving into the  . These rangers were those that felt most comfortable in the dark reaches of the Realms. They traveled through the   and other shadowy environments, destroying the evil creatures that dwelled within. These rangers were experts at setting up ambushes, always choosing precisely the right moment to take down their prey. \n Gloom Stalkers used the darkness of their surroundings to their advantage. They could see through dimly lit areas and melded into the shadows as if they were a predator in the night. The most skilled of these rangers could even move through the shadows to evade incoming harm. \n Some rangers committed their lives to the eradication of  , magic-wielding monstrosities. They studied specific spells that granted them better understanding of and protection from their prey, and developed supernatural powers to overcome the most daunting of foes, such as   and  . \n With careful study, Monster Slayers could discern a creature's weakness and focus their attacks to bring them down quickly. They employed means to nullify their prey's spellcasting abilities and deal lethal counter attacks at precisely the right moment. \n Swarmkeepers were those individuals that formed bonds with certain   than manifested in small forms, but appeared in great number. These rangers formed strong connections with their 'swarms' of spirits, and became forces of nature to be reckoned with. They could direct their swarms to attack foes, spy on far away places, or even envelop their own bodies allowing for magical translocation. \n A ranger that took on the swarmkeeper archetype was not obliged to hold a specific outlook on life, They would just as often prefer a life of solitude to one of communal living and cooperation with their neighbors. \n In addition to the various archetypes rangers filled, some rangers put extra effort into perfecting their favored fighting style. Some of the most commonly found ranger traditions are listed below.\n Archer rangers were masters of the   or (less commonly) other ranged weapons. Unlike other rangers who preferred to take their quarry on in a melee, archer rangers preferred to hunt from afar, resorting only to close combat when ranged attacks were no longer practical. Archer rangers were more nimble than their fellow rangers, focusing on finesse and delicate skill over brutal power in a fight, though most archer rangers were still fairly strong and had a keen awareness of their surroundings.  Archer rangers who continued to emphasize skill with ranged weapons sometimes became   or  .    were those elves that dedicated themselves to their peoples' tradition of treating archery a form of martial artistry. \n While many rangers preferred the elegance of the bow or the companionship of a beast, two-blade rangers found more solace in their skill with weapons of steel. These rangers, who were often stronger than their more nimble colleagues, focused on closing in on their prey and engaging them with melee weapons before darting away. Like all rangers, two-blade rangers preferred skirmishes to a straight fight, so speed and dexterity were very important to two-blade rangers, but if forced into a standstill they stood a better chance of surviving a melee than other rangers. Unlike most individuals who trained in the use of two melee weapons, two-blade rangers were trained to use two one-handed weapons of any size or type in either hand, making them potentially deadlier than most dual-wielding warriors.  Rangers who continued to focus on the use of two weapons over other pursuits sometimes became   or the  . \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger"},

Dwarves, sometimes called the   and  ,  were a tough, tradition-abiding folk known for their strong martial traditions and beautiful craftsmanship. \n Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 4'3\"\u20134'9\" (1.3\u20131.45 meters) on average,  with   a bit shorter.  What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk; they were, on average, about as heavy as  . A dwarf could weigh anywhere from about 160\u2013220 lbs (73\u2013100 kg).  Dwarven males were a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts.  Like humans, dwarves had a wide variety of skin, eye, and hair colors, typically pale among   and deeply tanned or brown amongst gold dwarves. Hazel eyes were common throughout the race, with blue eyes more common amongst shield dwarves and brown or green eyes found amongst the gold dwarves. \n Male dwarves were often bald and grew thick facial hair, which was sometimes used to display social status. Unusually for humanoids, both sexes naturally grew ample facial hair,  though the majority of shield dwarf females shaved their beards off.  Many dwarven women would do this to conform with the beauty standards of human societies, but some would revel in their long, luscious beards, or trim them in goatee-style.  This hair was often dark in hue, though among shield dwarves blond or red hair was just as common. Gold dwarves took the care of facial hair to an extreme, carefully oiling and grooming it,  with some adding   and ornamentations.  Naturally curly hair did not exist among the dwarves of Toril. Curles could only be achieved though deliberate styling. \n Dwarves were a long-lived race, though not so much as  , and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she reached age fifty.  Dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer period of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 years. Most dwarves lived to see their bicentennial  and a few lived to be over 400.  A dwarf was considered to be young until they reached the age of 50.  \n Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes.  Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity. \n Dwarven friendship was hard to earn, but was strong once won. Naturally dour and suspicious, the stout folk were slow to trust others, specifically those outside their family, suspecting the worst of an individual until the outsider had proved their good will many times. Once this trust was gained, dwarves held their friends to it and viewed betrayals, even minor ones, with a vicious propensity for vengeance.  A common gnomish oath, remarking on this dwarven sense of justice, was \"If I'm lying, may I cross a dwarf.\" \n For dwarves, loyalty was more than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. Dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. Many dwarven tales subsequently revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. Just as dwarves were known for their dependability as friends and allies, dwarves also harbored grudges far longer than many other races. This might be on an individual basis between a dwarf and one who had wronged them, or against entire races, even if warfare with the enemy had long since ceased. \n Dwarves were careful and deliberate, with a more serious disposition than other races, who they sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. A dwarf did all things with care and a stubborn resolve, with brash or cowardly behavior unusual for them. However, dwarves did succumb easily to wrath or greed, which were their most common vices. \n Dwarves who left their homeland to become adventurers did so for a number of reasons. In part, a dwarf might be motivated by simple avarice, given the dwarven love of beautiful things. As often, however, a dwarf might be motivated by a drive to do what was right for others (particularly their clan) or a love of excitement because, as settled as dwarves were, they rarely tired of thrills. But even these wayward dwarves retained the spirit of their brethren, hoping that their accomplishments abroad could bring honor to themselves, their clan, or both. Given that successful dwarven adventurers were likely to recover rare items or defeat enemies of the dwarven people during such challenges, this was a hope not entirely without merit. \n Dwarves were unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, were resistant to virtually all poisons and it took less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also had dense bodies and were difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads that other races might find hindering with little ill effect. Dwarves also had a sense about them that few races did, with a preternatural awareness of their surroundings useful for a subterranean race as well as good judgment all-around in general. \n Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as   or  , though this was not a trait common to all dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely unsocial and more than a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, something that sat well with their legendary crafting abilities. \n Dwarves could see in the dark, out to about 60 feet (18 meters). Many dwarves had an affinity for the caverns in which they lived, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could seem almost supernatural at times. \n A dwarf having a snooze after eating. Dwarves highly valued the ties between family members and friends, weaving tightly knit clans. Dwarves particularly respected elders, from whom they expected sound leadership and the wisdom of experience, as well as ancestral heroes or clan founders. This idea carried on to relations with other races and dwarves were deferential even to the elders of another, non-dwarven race. \n Likewise, dwarves, perhaps moreso than most other races, turned to   for guidance and protection. Non-evil dwarves looked to the divine for comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for methods through which to obtain power over others. Individual dwarves might be  , but the race as a whole, regardless of subrace, had a strong inclination for religion and almost every community maintained at least one temple or ancestral shrine. \n Most dwarven societies were divided into clans built along family ties and political allegiances. These clans were usually led by hereditary rulers, often monarchs of a sort and descended from the founder of the clan. Dwarves strongly valued loyalty to these rulers and to the clan as a whole and even objective dwarves tended to side primarily with their kin over other races or communities. \n These clan structures promoted a tradition of inbreeding. This was so excessive that it was considered one of the reasons for the dwarves' low birth rate. \n Most dwarven clans focused on one or two kinds of crafting, such as blacksmithing, jewelry, engineering, or masonry. Dwarves strove to avoid overspecialization by sending some of their youths to other clans to serve as apprentices, which also helped to foster racial unity. Because of their longevity, these apprenticeships might last decades. \n Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface and above the Underdark, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did. \n \nAs of the 14  century onward, dwarves could be found all across Faer\u00fbn, although the greatest numbers were in the Underdark, the  , the  , and the  . In their own homelands, dwarves continuously carved out new living space, mining the mountains' riches as they did so. Dwarves in general stuck to these locales, disliking travel, particularly along waterways, but those who lived in human lands could make themselves quite comfortable. Most who did made a living as mercenaries, smiths, or artisans of various kinds. Dwarves were eagerly sought after as warriors, their reputation for courage and loyalty making them excellent choices for bodyguards. \n Dwarves were firm believers in the righteousness of their own ways, yet were surprisingly tolerant of the cultures of others, much of which was due to their natural introversion. Polite dwarves normally declined to speak their minds about others regardless of their true feelings; behavior considered \"good enough\" was left alone and not considered their business. Certain violent behavior might prompt more direct forms of response, but for the most part dwarves would live and let live. They got along passably well with most other races, their pragmatism and sense of honor serving diplomacy well, and few reasonable societies could not come to some level of agreement of them. \n However, most dwarves commonly believed that true friendships could only be forged over long periods of time and a common saying was that \"the difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years\", meaning that few members of the shorter-lived races ever forged strong bonds with dwarves. There were exceptions, however, and some of the strongest friendships were those between a dwarf and a human whose grandparents and parents were also on good terms with the dwarf. \n Dwarves and   had a history of cordial relations, mutually seeing each other as family, however distant. One dwarven myth proposed that the gnomes were once dwarves and   a long-forgotten dwarven deity of magic known as Garal, who turned his devoted into gnomes. Dwarves held the outlooks the two had in common in strong regard, looking at gnomish culture with affectionate bemusement and gnomes often felt that dwarves had a grounding in the greater truths of the world that they themselves lacked. However, long-term contact between the two would likely cause irritation, for while they envied the dwarves, gnomes were unwilling to stick to their lifestyle. Dwarf strongholds were always open to gnomes, but few dwarves were comfortable enough with gnome ways to stay for long in their settlements. \n Similarly to gnomes, dwarves had a fondness for   comparable to an older brother's concern for a smaller, more awkward sibling. Dwarves prized the halfling talent for fitting in and lending a hand, while halflings admired the strong family ties and industriousness (as well as the nose for profit) of the dwarves. However, dwarves were usually stodgy and somewhat provincial in contrast to the more adventurous halflings. Furthermore, halflings, who did not hold martial prowess as important, saw dwarves as too war-like. Some dwarves mistook their disinterest for inability and could prove patronizing, yet halflings quietly dismissed this overbearing and somewhat arrogant attitude as part of dwarvish nature. Dwarves remained blissfully pleased with their relations besides vague concern and diplomatic offers of military aid. \n More than any other race, humans were capable of dwarven behavior, readily absorbing their virtues and able to value them almost equally. They looked up to the tradition, honor, conviction, and family values central to them, and admired dwarven martial skill and stonecraft. The two races had always been cordial neighbors at the very least, and when humans modeled their societies after dwarves, it was a source of pride and joy. However, humans were so morally and ethically flexible that they could also be almost elf-like, seeming flighty to their slow-paced ways. What all human nations shared was a short memory, and human adaptability was countered in their minds by cultural inconsistency. Still, if dwarves were good at anything, it was finding potential hidden below the surface, and so even in the darkest times, they never gave up on humanity. \n Dwarven and elven relations were infamously volatile, their vastly disparate perspectives on the relationship between the individual and society resulting in countless misunderstandings and feuds. While dwarves subjugated the individual in favor of the group, elves did the opposite, and while both ways of life worked for their respective races, it made it hard for the two to agree on specific plans. Dwarves were both frustrated and amused by their apparent flightiness, lack of family focus, and irresponsibility of a race that, given their long lives and magic power, should be some of the most responsible of all. The emotional elves usually saw the naturally reserved dwarves as too dour, foolishly failing to express themselves and their opinions. Dwarves and elves were both basically good however, and so agreed on the most important issues; like squabbling siblings, they jumped to the others' defense against outside forces despite their threats, shouts, and insults. \n Though primitive to their eyes, dwarves regarded   as kindred spirits, followers of Moradin's ways even if not consciously aware of it. Dwarves perceived them as gentle giants and felt affection for their distant friends, leading them to make the extra effort of frequently visiting their villages for trade. For their part, goliaths held dwarves in high regard; most couldn't make their jewelry or metal crafts and held in high esteem those that could, wishing that they had a similar aptitude for weapon-crafting. They would eagerly trade furs and meat for dwarven (and gnomish) wonders, and some of the bravest of their numbers would traverse mountain caves to trade with dwarven communities. \n Dwarves did not forgive past wrongs easily and the entire race had more or less declared war on   and   as a whole, wiping them out where they found them. Many dwarves viewed these races as a foul infestation of their mountain homes and felt it was their duty to purge them. Likewise, many dwarves viewed   and   with a similar hatred and few dwarves had forgotten their ancestral hatred of the   who'd once enslaved them. \n As competitors for underground resources, dwarves and kobolds frequently fought over subterranean claims. The anti-social sentiments and persecution complex of the kobolds made diplomacy difficult, and while the two didn't always attack each other, neither side needed much provocation to start fighting. Not helping their relations was how dwarves frequently allied with or fought for gnomes against kobold tribes. However, if the two ended up working together due to circumstance, they could discover a common work ethic able to form the foundation of respectful friendships. \n Dwarves had few set opinions on half-elves, each being a reflection of whatever culture they were raised in. Perhaps more than that of elves or humans, the half-elf mindset was acceptable with that of the dwarf, combining the relative order of humanity with the long view provided by elven blood. Wise dwarves knew half-elves to be acceptable intermediaries when dwarves and elves desperately needed to cooperate, while half-elves also appreciated the dwarven understanding of the long view and lack of sheer pretention sometimes displayed by elves. However, half-elves could just as easily combine elven frivolity with human hubris, and their wanderlust was difficult for dwarves to understand. Half-elves generally saw dwarves as inflexible and unyielding, unable to understand their inability to negotiate and try new things. \n Given the racial enmity between dwarves and orcs and the importance dwarves placed on lineage, it was easy to understand their temptation to hold distrust and resent half-orcs.  Half-orcs meanwhile thought dwarves would be funny if not so dangerous, for despite their capacity for drinking and raucousness they were serious, judgmental, task-oriented, and strict. However, half-orcs held respect for the strength and martial prowess, and further admired dwarven skill with stone and honesty while sharing an appreciation for simple pleasures. Dwarves were predisposed to letting those so inclined prove themselves, and the two could be surprisingly staunch companions, to the point that less traditional clans would adopt particularly worthy half-orcs, demonstrating the possibility for even the oldest grudges to be wiped clean. \n A dwarf in combat with a  . In regards to their distant cousins the  , duergar, and  , dwarven opinions varied. Many viewed their distant relations with sympathy for their prior enslavement.  On the other hand, duergar and dwarves had long been enemies, though trade between them was a possibility. \n There existed several dwarven subraces, the best known including:\n Like many races, the exact origins of the dwarves were lost in myth and legend. While many non-dwarven scholars believed that dwarves were not native to   or its successor worlds, most dwarves believed that their ancestors came from the heart of the planet itself, given life by   after being made by the All-Father's hammer in the  . These legends held that the dwarves fought their way to the surface world, overcoming the dangers they faced below through strength of arms and skill. \n The first known dwarven settlements on Abeir-Toril originated from the mountains of  . These dwarves settled underneath the junction between the three continents of  ,  , and  , and migrated in all directions from there, spreading across the face of all the planet, except for those who migrated northwards and came to rest in the mountains of  , becoming the ancestors of the  .  Those who turned westward to what would eventually become the continent of Faer\u00fbn settled in what was later  . The dwarves then migrated westward from there, founding many settlements. The first great kingdom of the dwarves was  , beneath the  . \n A dwarf in battle. The dwarves in Bhaerynden prospered for centuries but gradually began to endure schisms and fractures, which drove the dwarves apart. The first of these schisms occurred around   when  , the so-called \"Crusader\", led a westward migration from the caverns of Bhaerynden. The descendants of these dwarves would eventually become the shield dwarves and forged the vast empire of  . The god   created the  , who moved deeper into the earth and faded from common knowledge. \n Some time after this, Bhaerynden fell to the   shortly after their Descent following the  , and these southern dwarves were driven into exile, ending the ancient kingdom. Their descendants became known as the gold dwarves and would return millennia later with the collapse of Bhaerynden into the  , forming a new kingdom.  Another dwarven subrace emerged from some of these southern dwarves, who fled to   and embraced the ways of the jungle, becoming the wild dwarves. \n The last dwarven lineage formed from the shield dwarves of  . These hapless dwarves who lived beneath the   were in time captured and enslaved by the  , becoming the separate but related race known as the duergar.  Over the ages, the twisting of illithid   caused the duergar to grow more and more distant from their kin. \n In the middle of the    ,  the dwarves who had controlled the   were enslaved or cast out by the nascent   the  . \n Over the centuries, dwarves entered into a long decline and most of the ancient kingdoms that once stood had fallen by the 15  century DR. The shield dwarves saw parts of the North overrun and conquered by the orcs of   while to the south the gold dwarves were largely driven from their underground kingdom in the Great Rift towards the surface world. In spite of this, the dwarves remained a proud and hardy people, unshaken by the pitfalls that had befallen them. \n The most significant event in recent history for the dwarven peoples was the   of  , in which, after centuries of demographic decline, a sudden boom in fertility occurred, resulting in the births of many twins amongst the dwarves. The Blessing was widely believed to have been the work of Moradin, possibly as the culmination of a quest by a dwarven heroine or as part of some grander plan of the All-Father. One of the consequences of this sudden boon was, other than a demographic resurgence that helped bring the dwarves out of their decline, was a sudden shift in culture. The so-called thunder children were radical in comparison with their parents and during their lifetimes over the  , dwarves took a more active role in the world and abandoned some of their oldest traditions, such as the ancient fear of   and the  . \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarf"},

They would offer their services to surface dwellers they considered too strong to ambush, asking payment of fresh food, metal weapons, or surface trinkets in return. \n Blindheim were bipedal frog-like   that possessed a pair of huge eyes capable of emitting blinding beams of light at will. These beams were blocked by an extra eyelid while a blindheim was resting, but could be instantly emitted when the creature opened its eyes.  The beam was equivalent in strength to natural light, although if focused it could char flesh and bone.  The beams ceased upon a blindheim's death, after which their eyes appeared a dull gold in color. Other features of a blindheim's head included a mouth full of needle-like teeth and fang incisors, a long tongue,  and two flat nostrils. They possessed an acute sense of hearing that allowed them to identify the direction of those around them even when their eyes were shut. Their hands had four digits with hooked talons including a thumb and their webbed feet had three clawed toes. \n Blindheims were generally varying shades of yellow in color, with darker shades on their back and lighter shades on their underbelly.

When attacking, they used their eye beams or bit their targets if at close enough range, swallowing those that were tiny enough whole. \n Generally solitary, they could be encountered in small groups of up to four individuals, but would sometimes gather in large groups of tens or even hundreds of individuals and then move through an area as a ravening horde. These large groups would attack and devour all in their path before suddenly quietly dispersing back to their individual territories. \n Around 10% of the blindheim population were part of more advanced tribes, living in crudely constructed villages of between 30 and 120 members that spoke with rudimentary,  halting, croaking   and used tools.

Usually dwelling on the fringes of the Underdark, they would gather near routes used by merchants  and other travelers from the surface in order to try and obtain fresh food, metal weapons, or surface trinkets. \n Opportunistic ambushers, blindheim would attack those they encountered if they felt they had sufficiently superior numbers or greater strength, taking what they desired.

When interacting with surface dwellers, blindheim would insist that no one inform the sun of their existence and would endlessly ask questions about the sun's actions, anger, and attitudes. Believing that the sun could not possibly have forgotten their ancestors' heroic theft and that they were infamous and feared by all on the surface, blindheim became angry and offended should any surface dweller attempt to soothe their fears about the sun's wrath. \n Blindheim represented a unique source of light in the Underdark and,  although they were very rarely encountered, they proved particularly troublesome to those adverse to bright light, such as   and  .

Flamsterd was welcomed by the native Ffolk of the isle, and even began taking on apprentices from local Ffolk settlements. He constructed   atop a promontory on the southern peninsula from which he and his apprentices greatly improved the quality of life on the isle: crops and livestock thrived while storms would divert course from the area. \n As Flamsterd's apprentices grew in power, they began to compete with each other and to turn against their teacher.

The Moonshaes had strong connections to the  . \n By the standards of most realms in  , even the civilized parts of the Moonshae Isles felt untamed and wild. The land was famed for its dark forests, towering mountains, and ancient standing stones. The seas, straights, and channels separating the major and minor islands were treacherous, and served to keep the islands isolated.  There were said to be dozens if not hundreds of islands in the archipelago, even the smallest of which often boasted one or two small villages. \n Along the coasts, long flat beaches were found. Most lacked  , and instead comprised pebbles and rocks. Tides were significant among the islands. At low tide, the beaches could be exposed as much as a quarter mile (400 meters) from the waterline. At high tide, the water line could rise up to 10\u202ffeet  (3\u202fmeters). During storms, the beaches were battered by waves. The coastlines of the islands were dotted with bays and coves, where ships could find a safe harbor from the harsh northern seas.  The remaining coastlines were jagged rocks cloaked in mist. Tall cliffs of   towered over the water, some up to 500\u202ffeet  (150\u202fmeters) in height, capped by forests. These cliffs were worn smooth from exposure to the wind, and in the winter were covered with sheer ice. \n Further inland, stagnant saltwater marshes were usually found. These gray and desolate marches lacked trees and an odor of   hung constantly in the air. Traveling in these marshes was hazardous, with about 10% of the terrain being  .  Some of the fens and swamps in the Moonshaes rivaled those found in the jungles of  . These putrid and decaying swamps were filled with stagnant water. The  , on the island of  , was likely the most dangerous area in all the Moonshaes. \n Freshwater streams were common on the islands. Most were shallow, reaching a maximum depth of 3\u202ffeet  (91\u202fcentimeters). Most streams were not safe for boats because of rapids. The islands were home to a handful of rivers, which were deeper and calmer, and safe for boats. Ferries and bridges allowed for safe crossing. \n Much of the Moonshaes terrain was moorland. This rolling grassland was dotted with lakes, ponds, and swamps, but most of it was well-drained and dry. The terrain was safe and pleasant and was used as pasture for cattle and  . \n Mountains and highlands made up another sizable portion of the Moonshaes terrain. These rugged and twisted mountains were jagged and cracked from centuries of erosion. The steep mountains reached 8,000\u202ffeet  (2,400\u202fmeters) in height. From autumn to early spring, heavy snow covered the highlands, only melting away completely by summer. \n The climate of the Moonshaes was considered subarctic.  The weather was severe and generally unpleasant, with long winters and frequent rainfall.  The southeast of the archipelago was more temperate and mild,  thanks in part to the northwestern isles taking much of the brunt of the mighty storms that blew in from the Trackless Sea. \n During the winter, biting freezing wind roared across the moorlands, as the lack of cover caused the wind to sweep uninterrupted across the exposed terrain.  The winter also brought storms to the islands. These storms originated in the Trackless Sea, usually striking the islands from the northwest. Storm season began in late   and ended in  . Huge swells reaching 40\u202ffeet  (12\u202fmeters) in height made the sea unnavigable during storm season.  However, the oceanic currents created by the meeting of the Sea of Swords and the Trackless Sea served to prevent the temperature from dropping below freezing too often. \n Summers tended to be quite cool, wet, and misty. The same oceanic currents that blunted the worst of winter brought a near-constant chance of rain as well as heavy fog that could blanket the whole of the isles in the mornings and evenings. \n 23\u2009\u2109 \u22125\u2009\u2103 Hammer 28\u2009\u2109 \u22122\u2009\u2103 Alturiak 33\u2009\u2109 1\u2009\u2103 Ches 40\u2009\u2109 4\u2009\u2103 Tarsakh 60\u2009\u2109 16\u2009\u2103 Mirtul 70\u2009\u2109 21\u2009\u2103 Kythorn 76\u2009\u2109 24\u2009\u2103 Flamerule 75\u2009\u2109 24\u2009\u2103 Eleasis 69\u2009\u2109 21\u2009\u2103 Eleint 57\u2009\u2109 14\u2009\u2103 Marpenoth 48\u2009\u2109 9\u2009\u2103 Uktar 34\u2009\u2109 1\u2009\u2103 Nightal 0.2\u2009in 5\u2009mm Hammer 0.4\u2009in 10\u2009mm Alturiak 3.5\u2009in 89\u2009mm Ches 13.7\u2009in 348\u2009mm Tarsakh 12.8\u2009in 325\u2009mm Mirtul 9.4\u2009in 239\u2009mm Kythorn 7.5\u2009in 191\u2009mm Flamerule 20.4\u2009in 518\u2009mm Eleasis 11.7\u2009in 297\u2009mm Eleint 4.1\u2009in 104\u2009mm Marpenoth 2.5\u2009in 64\u2009mm Uktar 1.2\u2009in 30\u2009mm Nightal 67\u2009in 170\u2009cm Hammer 53\u2009in 135\u2009cm Alturiak 39\u2009in 99\u2009cm Ches 12\u2009in 31\u2009cm Tarsakh 0\u2009in 0\u2009cm Mirtul 0\u2009in 0\u2009cm Kythorn 0\u2009in 0\u2009cm Flamerule 0\u2009in 0\u2009cm Eleasis 0\u2009in 0\u2009cm Eleint 13\u2009in 33\u2009cm Marpenoth 47\u2009in 119\u2009cm Uktar 92\u2009in 234\u2009cm Nightal The islands were covered with thick deciduous forests of  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .

This subterranean realm spanned under the surrounding seas, connecting to   in the far west  as well as to Faer\u00fbn in the east via remote tunnels.  The Underdark was most readily accessed via sea caves in the   and through the  . \n Despite its wild and untamed reputation, the Moonshae Isles were and had long been rife with political intrigue and infighting between the various kingdoms and islands.  The land was historically divided among more than a dozen squabbling kingdoms,  not to mention the unaligned strongholds of   and   throughout the mountains. It was said that a claim had already been made on every corner of the vast wilderness of the islands, although this included the island's   who served as protectors of its woodlands and had to be consulted before felling any tree. \n In  , the majority of the Moonshae Isles came together to form the   under High Queen  , who ruled from the capital city of   on  .  The warlords who ruled the Northlanders (who had long styled themselves as \"kings\") adopted a new title of \"jarl\" to denote their vassal status. \n By the late 15  century DR,   remained the nominal rulers of the Moonshaes but had lost much of their control over the isles, and by  , their kingdom only encompassed much (but not all) of the isle of  .

The Isle of   was under the de facto control of the  , a group of    . \n Each kingdom of the Moonshaes, while somewhat self-sufficient, had some amount of trade with one another. Most goods traveled on ships from port to port, although some overland trade occurred between realms that shared an island. Nearly all sea trade occurred during summer, with traffic falling by half during the spring and autumn and brought to a halt by the fierce winters.  Even as enemies, the Ffolk and Northlanders were known to engage in commerce with each other, albeit warily. \n The major external trading partners of the Ffolk were  ,  ,  ,  , and  .  Pirates threatened the waters around the Moonshaes,  but the Isles benefitted from providing a relatively safer route up and down the Sword Coast as compared to sailing through the  , thus making Ffolk ports a common stopover between   and Calimshan.   , with its sprawling and accessible port, was the main commerce and trading hub of the Moonshaes. Merchants from all over   could be encountered here. Exported goods bound for Waterdeep or Calimshan were shipped from the city, and imports from outside were brought in.  The Moonshaes were one of the few lands where ships from   were known to call. \n Waterdhavian merchants sought to trade cloth, oil, or spice for high-quality   crafted by the Ffolk. Calishite merchants brought  , parchment,  , and   in their  . The southern merchants sought fur, metals and  . Timber from the islands was in high demand, as it was the only easily accessible location for the large trees required to build  . Some Calishite merchants sailed the extra week to trade in the ports on Corwell or Moray. \n Some Waterdhavians also stopped in the ports of the Northlanders, who mostly otherwise traded with  . The Northmen traded   and Ffolk weapons for alcohol, cloth,  , and oil. \n The inhabitants of the Moonshaes were wary of cold-hearted merchants who sought only to pillage their natural resources for financial gain.  Tarnian shipbuilders from  , an island that had exhausted its supply of timber, were a frequent sight in Caer Callidyrr. They arrived in the city, purchased enough raw materials to build another ship, then sailed back to Mintarn in both vessels. \n Moonshavian merchants brought ale and livestock from Corwell, and   and   ore from Moray, to Caer Callidyrr to be traded for high-quality weapons.  By the late 14  century DR, the Moonshae had an established   mining and minting. The Moonshae gold had a unique telltale tint \u2013 rose, the shade found nowhere else in the Realms. Occasionally, the Moonshae gold was used to create enchanted jewelry that could be found as far as the mage nation of  . However, Moonshae gold was considered to be of lesser quality than gold jewelry of Halruaa. \n Amnian merchants aspired to dominate the isles and exploit their natural resources.  As of the late 15  century DR, Amnian businesses and immigrants had gained increasing influence across the Isles,  and Amnian   (referred to as  ) had become common in circulation.  At the same time, the fey of Gwynneth had begun minting gold pieces that were acceptable for doing business beyond their borders, although Moonshae merchants expressed suspicion when handed such coins. \n The Moonshae Isles were populated mainly by  , who far outnumbered the various other  .  These humans were split between the   and the  , two societies which had been rivals and enemies for centuries. During the 15  century  , these two groups intermarried and became more culturally unified.  They came to see themselves as complementary stewards of their home, with the Ffolk venerating the land and the Northlanders revering the sea. The bulk of the human population resided on the eastern island of Alaron.  \n The islands' inhabitants were known to be both physically and spiritually stubborn.  Large settlements were rare, and most Moonshavians lived in isolated villages separated by large stretches of harsh landscapes,  which often instilled a strong sense of self-reliance and independence in the people. This in turn made them readily suited to life as   should the need arise,  with many such Moonshavians favoring the professions of  ,  , druid, or  .  Both the Ffolk and the Northlanders were skeptical of   and suspicious of its practitioners, making   fairly rare across the isles. \n The lands of the Ffolk were traditionally those of the southern islands.  They were skilled at farming, fishing, and hunting. They were also adept traders. While they were more peaceful than the Northlanders, they were still a strong and hardy folk capable of defending themselves.  \n The Northlanders traditionally claimed the northern isles,  and were a warrior society ruled by warlord kings. Adventure and combat were an essential part of life for them. Pillaging each other and Ffolk settlements was a regular occurrence. Both the Ffolk and Northlanders were skilled mariners. \n The original   of the isles were the  , who lived in isolation in their valley of   on the island of  .

The   of the isles were known for their crafting  and their warlike culture. They lived mostly in isolated holdings scattered around the isles,  the most notable of which was   on Gwynneth  and subsequently the   of Alaron.  Aside from shield dwarves, Gwynneth was also home to savage tribes of \" \"  and the   of Norland were home to  .

Rather than clerics, she was venerated by druids at sacred pools known as  . She was widely believed to be an aspect of the    , however this view was not shared by many of the Ffolk.  The isles were one of the greatest centers of druidic power in all of Faer\u00fbn,  although the druids of the Moonshaes considered themselves largely distinct from the druids of the mainland.  The only other god known to be acknowledged by the druids of the Moonshaes was  . \n In the 14  century DR, Northlanders primarily worshiped a storm-themed   of   who drove them to raid and plunder their neighbors.  They also worshiped the   and  , and some were also known to venerate  . The worship of these gods was often little more than cursory for the Northlanders and dependent upon whether or not they were residing in the god's sphere of influence.  The Northlander faith expanded in the 15  century, introducing the deity   to their pantheon and giving Valkur much more prominence. The latter became viewed as the most important among the gods, embodying the qualities the Northlanders valued most in life. \n Starting around  , clerics from various faiths began visiting the Isles, with the goal of converting the islanders to their faith and establishing churches. The reactions of the islanders were mixed, with the Northlanders killing the clerics while the Ffolk generally considered the clerics harmless and a source of entertainment. The foreign clerics successfully converted a handful of Ffolk, but the vast majority of the Ffolk remained faithful to their traditional religion. \n In  , during the  ,   was banished from the Moonshaes.

While in truth the firbolgs were descendants of   and  ,  the firbolgs of the Moonshaes believed that Grond carved them from stone and that the   were the result of the \"leftovers\" of this process.  Before Grond was reawakened, many of the firbolgs of the Isles were ruled by  , an aspect of  ,  while others venerated the Earthmother. \n Worship of   was popular among the lycanthropes of the isles in the late 15  century DR.  The druids of the Earthmother and Silvanus clashed viscously with the faithful of Malar. \n   , the supercontinent   was fractured by the  . The Moonshaes were formed after a continental plate shifted to the west. During this time, the Moonshaes were little more than a collection of hundreds of islands formed by volcanic peaks. By  , the Moonshaes began forming into their modern shape. \n   ,   began settling the Moonshaes. After about 5,000 years, the   founded the kingdom of  , constructing the city of   on an island in the center of the lake within  . Then, around  ,   refugees began arriving on the islands. They were welcomed by the LeShay, and settled in the mountains and formed the kingdom of  . In parallel with these migrations, the   also arrived in the Isles. \n   ,   arrived in the Moonshaes, accompanied by a tribe of giants who settled on Norland in the  . After conflict erupted between the dwarves and firbolgs, Grond Peaksmasher was imprisoned. Without his guidance, the firbolgs of the Moonshaes became uncivilized. \n  unleashed   to wreak havoc on the Moonshaes for the first time    . The Children of the Earthmother united with the Llewyrr and dwarves to battle the Beast, while it brought fomorians from the Feywild to be its allies. The conflict dragged on for decades until the minions of Kazgaroth were driven to isolated corners of the Moonshaes. The fomorians conquered the firbolgs, forcing them into slavery. In the aftermath of this conflict, Sarifal fell into decline.    , most of the fey, including the fomorians, abandoned their domains in the Moonshaes and retreated back into the Feywild. The kingdom of Sarifal was abandoned and the city of Karador sank into the Myrloch. \n Since the days of Sarifal, the humans of the Trackless Sea had long avoided settling the Moonshaes, believing them to be   and fearing the fey tricksters who had resided there. Thus, humans did not arrive in the Moonshaes until the  , when refugees fleeing from the persecution of the   crossed the Sea of Swords and settled on the island of  , beginning the race of the Ffolk. They were led by the  , and soon came into conflict with Synnoria. \n In the  , the human settlements of Gwynneth united to form the kingdom of  , which soon fell into civil war until the  , when it was reunited under King  . In the  ,   took control of Kazgaroth, sending it to destroy the Ffolk. Callidyrr's son,  , defeated Kazgaroth and was crowned High King of the Ffolk, founding the  .   marks this year as year one on the Moonshavian calendar. \n In the  , High King Cymrych Hugh died and was entombed within a barrow mound near  . His heirs lacked a strong claim to the throne, and as a result the kingdoms of the Moonshaes splintered.  The situation worsened in the  , when   sailors from   and   arrived in the Moonshaes, beginning centuries of Northmen raiding and tribute collecting from the divided Ffolk realms. \n In the  , High King   waged success wars against both the Northmen and his rebellious subjects.  He constructed the   from the skulls of his enemies, where he held court and brought his enemies to die in the  . He and   eventually went mad. \n In the  , a large group of immigrants from   arrived on the islands and settled among the Ffolk. The newly arrived Tethyrians brought their religious beliefs with them, but most Ffolk maintained their faith in the Earthmother. Architects and engineers among the immigrants shared their knowledge with the Ffolk, allowing the Ffolk to construct improved defensive fortifications. As a result, raids from Northlanders dropped over the next few centuries. \n In the  , an Illuskan fleet of   invaded the Moonshaes. High King   was killed when his small fleet of   was destroyed in  . By  , the Ffolk had surrendered the northern islands to the Illuskan invaders. This marked the end of the Cymrych Dynasty of High Kings and the start of the  , who were High Kings in name only. \n The Northmen were a violent, war-like society with little interest in or tolerance of the Ffolk's monarchical ways. Historically, this created a continuous tension between the two human peoples, with Northmen raids on Ffolk farmsteads a common occurrence.  In the mid\u201314  century DR, this conflict escalated into what was termed the Darkwalker Wars, which lasted a number of years. In the  , ,   brought his host of   to  's   on Oman's Isle to prepare an attack on the southern Moonshaes. In the first council of northern Kings and Captains, Thelgaar announced his intention of making long-lasting peace with the   and starting a prosperous trading relationship. But most of the warriors present disagreed and decided to go along with the plan to raid and pillage the cities of   and   and the rest of the Ffolk lands. That same night, Thelgar was slain by  , who took the identity of the king and supported the attack on Caer Corwell. \n  to Caer Corwell, Kazgaroth, in Thelgar's shape, challenged and killed the Leviathan, one of the children of the goddess Earthmother. Around the town and fortress of Caer Corwell, the Northmen were halted by the combined forces of   and his companions. They would go on to slay Kazgoroth. \n By the  , Tristan had claimed the title of High King of the Ffolk, and forged a peace agreement with many of the Northlander kingdoms known as the  . \n The Moonshae's struggles against evil attracted the concern of the  , who expanded their presence in the isles. \n In the  ,   sensed the imminent return of the Earthmother to the Moonshaes. Angered by her return, the god Talos attempted to throw the islands into chaos by turning the Ffolk and Northlanders against each other again. To achieve this goal, Talos recruited an army of pirates,   from   ,and even a   named  . Princess   aided in the release of the   of  . She was corrupted by Talos and was later killed by her sister Alicia Kendrick. \n Alicia Kendrick was crowned High Queen after High King Tristan Kendrick abdicated his claim to the throne to be with his wife, Queen Robyn. She had left the capital to live in   in order to commune with the Earthmother. \n The conflict between the Northlanders and the Ffolk waned with the hard work of High King Tristan Kendrick and later through his daughter, High Queen Alicia Kendrick. In the  , Northlander kings swore fealty to Alicia, creating the United Moonshae Isles. This marked the first time that Ffolk and Northlanders were truly united, and intermarriage between the Ffolk and the Northlanders of Alaron began to erode some cultural differences between them.  The Northlander kings adopted the title of \"Jarl\" and continued to rule their kingdoms as vassals.  While not all Northlanders ceased their raids on the Ffolk, and while some petty lords continued to feud between themselves, the bigger threat to peace at this time was the risk of pirate attacks out of the nearby  .  This was overshadowed by the   of the  , when the     torched the Moonshae capital of Caer Callidyrr and set ablaze the  , killing Alicia's husband, High King  , in the process.  \n High Queen Alicia also worked to reduce the Isles' longtime isolation from the mainland,  and foreign adventurers could find work in her kingdom as sellswords and guards. \n Beginning in the  , the wardens of the druid groves in Myrloch Vale had started to vanish after receiving summons to enter the moonwells. In the  , Robyn and Tristan Kendrick entered the Great Moonwell in Myrloch Vale to investigate the vanishing druids. They ended up in the Feywild. By  , fey had begun to arrive in the Moonshaes, traveling through the moonwells. They settled primarily in Myrloch Vale and  . In the  , with violent encounters increasing between the Ffolk and fey, human settlements around Myrloch Vale were abandoned.  Then in the  , fomorians under the leadership of Queen Connomae invaded   from the Feywild, driving out the Northlanders within the year. \n In the  , the fey city of Karador rose again from the waters of the Myrloch on the island of Gwynneth. The   High Lady Ordalf proclaimed herself queen of the island, giving it the name of Sarifal.  This precipitated a slow but inexorable expansion of the fey into the lands of   despite the best efforts of House Kendrick.  At the same time, the planar barrier with the Feywild continued to grow weaker over the following decade leading up to the Spellplague. \n The power of the Kendrick dynasty fell into decline following the invasion of Snowdown by Amnian forces in the  , which they proved powerless to prevent.  This was followed by High Queen Alicia's death (and presumed assassination) in the  , precipitating an insurgency led on behalf of a rival claimant to the throne,  .  Amnian mercenaries then put Corwell to the torch, allowing High Lady Ordalf to expel the remaining humans from Gwynneth in the  .  In the subsequent years leading up to 1479 DR, events conspired to strip House Kendrick of many of their lands. As of that year, High King   aspired to reclaim his family's former glory regardless of the risks of armed conflict. \n By  , the isle of Gwynneth had become ever more deeply connected to the Feywild. In the northern forests of the island, Prince  , son of Ordalf, fought against dark fey who sought to take the land for themselves. Meanwhile, High King Derid Kendrick sought to establish an embassy, but couldn't find a way to secure Lady Ordalf's permission.  Around the same time, the fomorians of Oman's Isle attempted to invade Gwynneth  and the isles had to contend with a number of terrible attacks by foreign red dragons, including  's attack on Norland  and  's attacks on Alaron and Gwynneth. \n As of the end of the 15  century DR, the fey of the Moonshaes were said to be disappearing, with rumors and tall tales claiming everything from a retreat into the Feywild to large numbers of abductions.  Meanwhile, relations between the Northmen and Ffolk had transformed over the preceding century from direct confrontation into an awkward form of tolerance as the two learned to share the islands. However, this was in part due to the problems both cultures had on their respective home islands. \n The Moonshaes were dominated by six major islands and dozens if not hundreds of minor ones, even the smallest of which often boasted one or two small villages. \n In addition to the core Moonshae archipelago, the ancestral home island of the Northlanders, Ruathym, was sometimes regarded as an honorary Moonshae despite being located about 200\u202fmiles  (320\u202fkilometers) to the north.  Likewise, Mintarn and its surrounding islands were sometimes regarded as part of the broader Moonshaes. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moonshae_Isles"},

In this particular form, the Schismed spoke in a discordant tone. \n Abysm had long succumbed to  , its madness so terrible that merely attempting to reach out to the vestige was known to drive binders to the brink of lunacy in seconds. However, sometime soon before the late 14  century  , the Schismed regained a measure of its senses\u2014at least, according to some reports. This made it possible for it to bind to a host without danger to the mortal's mind. \n The Schismed maintained a measure of its original   abilities, able to use these skills to draw people into its territory and teleport them back out across the whole of  .

The vestige similarly lent access to certain psionic devotions, though it was limited in this regard. Abysm was only known to impart the use of  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .

The place was suffused with   energies, and even the powerful, surviving Jhaamdathi could not overcome the psionic blocks placed upon   by both the Schismed and Bpdethrys. \n Like most vestiges, the tether between Abysm and its latest host manifested through a series of physiological oddities.

Founded and run by the retired adventuring    , it delivered exotic and luxury items sourced from all over world to its shops located in many cities via extensive use of teleportation magic. Customers ordered these items from the  . \n Welcome to Aurora's Emporium!\n The logo of the company was the face of an attractive woman within a circle. While many thought this to be Aurora herself,  not many people had actually seen her and reports from those who had conflicted.  (It did depict her, but as a younger woman.) In any case, it appeared on all staff and shipments: pressed into the wax seals of packaged goods, painted onto containers, and as a  -and-  badge worn by employees.  At least one portrait of Aurora was drawn by in-house inventor Nadul DaRoni. \n Aurora's Emporium stocked and sold a vast assortment of goods, leaning toward smaller luxury items, exotic wares, rarities, and quality pieces,  such as jewelry, clothing and costumes, toys and games, cosmetics and personal grooming, and so on, but also a variety of foods and beverages, common tools, household and business supplies, hardware, and alchemical supplies.  They avoided trading animals,  ,   (\"for obvious reasons\", according to Aurora),  , and  ,  because they could not sell one-size-fits-all armor pieces or swords not balanced to a warrior's liking.  Customers who sought such things would be referred to more appropriate merchants  or  , but would not transport such things even if arrangements were made.  Otherwise, they dealt in a wide range of tools and equipment suited to  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and adventurers in general, as well as survival gear, first-aid and medical equipment, and dungeoneering tools and light sources. \n They had no knowing involvement in poor-quality, black-market, stolen, or other illicit goods.  Aurora used her own   magic could to guarantee this.  On the other hand, they sold   and other items that aided in larceny and trickery, on the expectation they be used for ethical purposes, and only where legal to sell. \n Musical instruments were inspected and guaranteed by Waterdeep's  ,  Meanwhile,   were printed in Waterdeep on high-quality paper made from timber cut in the   and bound with the close supervision of the  . \n To acquire its wide selection of quality merchandise, Aurora's Emporium employed a network of agents operating in many regions of Faer\u00fbn, especially the  , and even some parts of   (as far as  ) and   (as far as Tukan).  They identified goods that might be suitable, confirmed that they not stolen or sold on the black market, bought them, and transported them to the central warehouse,  wherever it was currently located, or if more remote, a trading post shop in one of the major trade centers.  Transport was arranged by other Emporium employees or trusted agents familiar with their standards and protocols, and was handled by other merchants and caravanners. Emporium teamsters regularly worked alongside these caravans, even those also transporting non-Emporium goods. \n Aurora's purchased from many reputable merchants, as well as individual craftsmen, wholesalers, and even itinerant peddlers.  Among those businesses in the   that sold their wares through Aurora's Wholesalers   1370 DR were   in   and   the cheesemaker in  , both in  ;  the   in   in  ;  and the   in   in  .  In the  ,   the Trader of   was a purveyor of goods for Aurora's.  In the early 1360s DR, fabrics were manufactured in  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  , and even   in Maztica, and furs came from all over the   and elsewhere,  while finished articles of clothing were made in Suzail from Daerlunian cloth and wool. There was also    , Elturian  ,   from  , and cotton weaves from Maztica. Shoes were made by the   in   and came in sizes of  ,  ,  /children, and jumbo.  Novelty armored undergarments were manufactured at   in Waterdeep, at least those tame and tasteful enough to sell; these were made-to-order to the customer's measurements. \n At the central warehouse, Emporium employees comprising laborers, scribes, and accountants kept careful record of incoming and outgoing goods to maintain an up-to-date inventory. They conducted a full stocktake every three months. The majority of goods were stored in central warehouse, though some common items were kept in stock in the shops for quick delivery. \n Each shop and the central warehouse was furnished with a magical   platform as a target for   goods to and fro.  These were marked with large depictions of the Aurora's Emporium logo and distinguished by specific configurations of magical fields within the targets that the service-mages could focus their   spells on, which avoided the needed to update targets when the central warehouse relocated and the need for mages to be familiar with the geography.  Bulky items were magically   in size for convenience and returned to full size a few minutes after arrival.  By relying on   spells for delivery, the problem of theft   was obviated. \n The Aurora's Emporium teleportation network remained operational as of the late 1480s DR. \n Meanwhile, customers browsed the   and placed orders for various items at their local Aurora's Whole Realms Shop.  Every Aurora's outlet had several copies of the catalogue, enough for all would-be customers,  as might a few inns, especially those with libraries for guests, such as the   in Shadowdale  and   in Westgate.  Otherwise, it was forbidden to take catalogues out of the store, owing to the high cost of public distribution. The catalogue outlined the business and detailed all goods, while clerks explained the ordering process. Customers were encouraged to ask if they wanted something not in the catalogue, in case it was in stock but not yet in the current catalogue.  Customers paid a 25% deposit on most orders, although for a few items full upfront payment was required and same-day delivery was often available for a nonrefundable 15% surcharge.  Thieving equipment was one area that required full payment in advance, thieves being what they are.  The deposit would be refunded should Aurora's Emporium be out of stock.  Orders were received daily as of 1370 DR. \n Each morning and at close of business each day, the orders were delivered to the central warehouse, often via   cast by the on-site service-mage. \n At the central warehouse, staff would receive these orders, check if an item was in stock, collect all the items required, and update the inventory. Items were labelled with the customer's name and the price paid, bulky items were   via magical spells if required, and all were grouped together for transport to specific stores. They were then loaded onto a   platform, and sent to the target shop all at once. Reduced items would return to normal size after a few minutes, or else be  . \n Sometimes, substitutions were made: if a specific item was not in stock, then a comparable item would be provided instead, though the customer was free to decline on pick-up.  In addition, cloths and clothing were available in select colors, with standard ones in the catalogue and additional ones available through the store, with gray, beige, black, brown, and white always available. Moreover, Aurora's had a dyeing service with a wide range of common and exotic dyes. Customers could peruse a provided swatch booklet and request the fabrics be dyed in other colors for 10% extra and a further 3 to 4 days before delivery; typically, this was 2   for blue, green, red, and yellow.  Musical instruments could blessed by   for double the price and time for delivery.  Conversely, clerical and priestly items had no blessing or sanctification applied. \n They would also act as wholesalers, selling goods in bulk at a discount for other businesses to sell on to customers; the   tavern in Waterdeep was one customer of this service,  while   of   in  ,  , and a good friend to Aurora, purchased as many novelties as she could for resale.  A representative of the library-fortress of   made an annual mass order of books. \n After submitting an order, a customer could normally collect their goods from their Aurora's Whole Realms Shop in two to three days, unless delayed by a major holiday, war, or political turmoil at the source of the goods, a catastrophe, or other unforeseen event or overriding need; clerks could give a more exact estimate. Orders were processed in order they were received, but an outlet in a region struck by a natural disaster would receive priority for emergency wares like food, clothes, and blankets.  Some upmarket stores would deliver direct to their customers, such as the Waterdeep Way outlet, which would deliver within the city's Castle Ward using the shop's own coach. \n The balance of any payment was due upon pick-up at the outlet shop.  Customers were permitted to inspect the goods at the shop. Items found to be unsatisfactory and returned by the customer were fully refunded, but after the customer left the shop with the item, no refunds or returns or exchanges were accepted. Items that were not collected remained at the outlet for fourteen days or two  , after which they were returned to the central warehouse and the deposit was forfeited.   Customers could ask the store to hold their goods for longer. \n Aurora's also designed and manufactured their own goods for sale, by their in-house   artisans, to fill specific adventuring niches. These included the  , a specialist shovel, entrenching tool, and improvised weapon; and holders and straps for the   for easy carrying.  Prime among these artisans was the   and inventor  , who had a workshop in the   mountains near  .  Several of his outlandish inventions were illustrated in  , but as special orders with no guarantees. \n From time to time, Aurora's Emporium would arrange   to obtain some rare or unique desired items or to intervene on the rare occasion when a shipment went missing or was stolen. Investigators would also be enlisted to look into the origin of goods when suspicions arose. \n Employees might also be charged with selling special and   goods independently of the main business, some from Aurora's own sizeable collection of magical treasures. For example, the merchant   sold several unique items from   and three relics of the famed explorer   (stolen from a museum in  ) in the   in   in  ,  , in the  ,  while the   outlet sold magic items around  . \n The company also had field representatives who would survey customers, especially adventurers, about their satisfaction with products, the effectiveness of items purchased, and which were actually required, in order to refine their offerings. For example, ahead of the late 1360s Undermountain sale in Waterdeep, they found that pre-stocked adventurer's backpacks sold best when including only essentials selected based on the assumption of a balanced adventuring party and the strongest carrying the greatest loads, and leaving room for other equipment as needed. They also found that backpacks with frames that distributed weight onto the hips rather than the shoulders were popular with a 98% satisfaction rating, and so switched to these designs exclusively. \n The business was founded upon three pillars: \n Aurora would dismiss any member of staff whom she felt did not keep all three of these principles central to their work, particularly those who bought substandard or illicit goods or inflated prices. \n Despite this, for Aurora, the business was but a hobby to keep herself active and put her talents to good use; she ran it for personal entertainment, not out of capitalist desire for profit. If she ever wearied of it or found it repeatedly operating at a loss, then she would start scaling back the business, by either reducing operations, shutting down remote outlets, or decreasing quantities and kinds of stock. Fortunately, as of 1370 DR, the business remained prosperous and successful and Aurora was satisfied and still seeking out new and noteworthy goods to stock. \n Despite the scale of its operations, as of   Aurora continued to run her company along the lines of a small business, thanks to the ease of teleportation. While Aurora managed her namesake Emporium, she had her friend   as an assistant to deal with everyday affairs and an accountant-wizard   to oversee the central warehouse. Shop clerks, service-mages, and remote scouts reported to either Aurora or Jhegaan, and both were kept apprised of deliveries and daily happenings, while warehousemen reported to Thane. Shop clerks were in charge of hiring guards for the security of their stores. \n Aurora was succeeded by her daughter,  , who had the difficult task of leading the company through the Spellplague of 1385 DR. Her daughter   in turn was keen to revive the company's fortunes in the early 1490s DR. \n Aurora's Emporium employed people in a variety of roles: clerks to take orders and run their outlets, guards to protect shops and caravans, remote buyers and remote scouts to discover and purchase new goods, and junior   and   as service-mages for mundane spellcasting. They also on occasion hired adventurers and investigators to look into lost or stolen goods and suspicious wares.  In addition, a small staff of artists and scribes were retained for writing and illustrating the   and preparing it for copying, while apprentice mages did the actual magical copying and distributing it to outlets. \n The company preferred people of good character and dependable nature, and who could recognize a good deal when they saw one. Furthermore, a person with a recommendation from Aurora's Emporium was in good standing for more lucrative work with other merchants and explorers. In particular, clerks were expected to be adept in handling customers and appraising goods for flaws, and must also be able to work alongside wizards and not be afraid or suspicious of  . Shop guards were required to resolve confrontations peacefully and nonlethally, and to let local authorities takeover dealing with miscreants. Remote buyers must be highly skilled in appraisal and local knowledge, to help them monitor local markets for quality goods to acquire and keep up-to-date with mercantile affairs, usually with the aid of a number of local contacts. Remote scouts, in turn, were often   and aboveboard   who could travel in search of novel wares and forge good relations with new cultures. Finally, the  service-mages must be capable of casting  , whether innately or by a magic item, and were trained in using the   platforms in the shops and central warehouse and in locating employees by their badges.  Job advertisements were posted on noticeboards in each store. Pay was promised to be good and appropriate to the difficulty and hazards of the work. \n Standard employees were paid on a monthly basis, with their earnings being   to them the same way as were goods. The remote scouts were granted generous funds in local coin for buying goods and submitted reports on expenditure for their reimbursement each month. \n A central warehouse was maintained but had no fixed location; instead, it and its goods, equipment, and staff were moved in their entirety roughly once per year in order to maintain security and privacy, to deter both thieves and competitors.  The location was a closely kept secret.  Ahead of relocation, staff were steadily transferred to the new site to get familiarized and then, during a planned quiet period following a holiday,   spells were employed to transfer the contents of the warehouse   to the new site. The   targets did not need to be updated, thanks to their design. The central warehouse site was typically cycled between the cities of Waterdeep, Westgate, Marsember, and Saerloon, but occasionally to more distant and isolated places. \n  1370 DR, the majority of Aurora's Emporium outlets were to be found in the  , with every significant city from the   in the west to Cormyr and Sembia in the east having a shop and the biggest having one in each district or ward.  A great number of customers across the North were supplied by Aurora's Emporiums.  Further east, many of the realms around the   had at least one shop within their borders. Beyond the Heartlands and Inner Sea, a region might have a smaller outlet or simply a representative who could arrange orders with the closet outlet. In major trade centers in more remote areas of Faerun and on other continents, an outlet acted served as both shop and trading post, allowing a trader to sell their goods to the central warehouse. \n Outlets were known to be located in:\n Apart from the shops and outlets, Aurora's Emporium had mobile agents operating across the land, with roughly the same distribution and density as the shops. \n Surprisingly, even the isle of   had a single   agent. Her primary role was not importing foreign goods or exporting elven ones, but rather procuring elven items sold in Faerunian markets and returning them to the elven homeland. \n Perhaps unsurprisingly, Emporium staff were well supplied for whatever job they had to do, often with tools and equipment from their own stock. In particular, buyers and sellers were equipped with high-quality   to weigh goods and with signet rings to indicate their authority. \n Moreover, all employees were issued with company badges and those of higher rank had badges bearing minor   like  ,  , and   usable once each day. (Aurora borrowed this idea from  .) These had a dual function: Emporium wizards were trained to locate other employees via their badges, helping to find any who should go missing. Hence, Emporium employees relied on their badges for rescue if they got lost or into trouble. \n Aurora herself had a number of magic items of her own from being an adventurer, but favored those useful for overseeing her business. These included   for close examination of proposed goods and a   for communicating with and keeping tracking of her agents. \n Aurora's Whole Realms Shops were popular  and famous,  and many city dwellers either lived near one or were at least passingly familiar with the contents of the  . Their reliability, quality, and quick delivery made them the preferred choice in an emergency. \n Despite their similar lines of work, Aurora's Emporium usually enjoyed good relations with other merchants and caravanners, for a few reasons.  First, these was an effective lack of competition between them as the Emporium specialized in small and rare luxury goods that would not turn a high profit, whereas traditional merchants preferred to transport common goods in bulk and smugglers in contraband, .  Second, the Emporium regularly hired merchants and caravanners to transport such goods for them, while Emporium teamsters worked alongside caravans bearing non-Emporium goods. Third, if an Emporium clerk received a request for something they did not stock or could not deliver within a required timeframe, then they would refer the customer to a regular merchant who could at the best rate. Clerks therefore had to stay up-to-date on merchants in their area, and the merchants appreciated this fairness and honesty. \n In contrast, traditional shopkeepers had much to fear from an Aurora's outlet opening up in their area and in competition with them,  and viewed the whole operation with suspicion.  They worried her agents, or spies, were everywhere. Some hoped to preempt this by becoming an Aurora's outlet themselves. \n Aurora was a former   and accomplished mage  who had traveled the length and breadth of Faer\u00fbn and grown fascinated by the wide variety in cultures, cuisines, and comforts she encountered.  A few years after retirement, she settled down but sought a way to stay active, stave off boredom, and sate her love of exploration, and so she founded her business.  Her first shop was a little place in Waterdeep, named Aurora's Emporium, and it was initially only open for a few days each month after she came home from her travels bearing more exotic goods.  Nevertheless, Aurora made wise investments in the business.  Her fellow adventurer and friend, Jhegaan the Maestro, elected to stay and help her, discovering a previously unguessed-at good business acumen. \n From such humble beginnings, the business grew and she began to open shops across Faer\u00fbn.  An Aurora's Emporium enjoyed success wherever one opened  and in the early 1360s DR, Aurora reported that she had a new outlet opening each month, promising that there was a good chance that someone reading her catalogue would soon have a store opening conveniently close to them.  Before long, it had become a multi-armed company that spanned the Realms and had agents in places further than even Aurora had traveled. \n At some point, the gnomish inventor Nadul DaRoni came across a flyer for the new store in Suzail, Cormyr, and thought it a good way to showcase his creations and be recognized. He located Aurora in   while she was attending an event hosted by   and forcefully insisted his works should be included in  . Aurora flatly rejected him. Nevertheless, he persisted and pestered until eventually Aurora agreed to examine his notes and tour his workshop, and cautiously agreed to present a handful of them. \n The wizard/accountant Thane of Westgate was promoted to manager of the central warehouse    . \n Famed travelogue writer   was known to buy his   cheeses and stout ales through   in the 1360s DR.  Meanwhile, thanks to their appearances in  ,  \u2014made from the milk of the  \u2014achieved infamy  and   became a popular export of  .  However, shopkeepers like   of   in  ,  , dreaded the competition with an Aurora's outlet and suspected her spies. Argyr wrote letters to Aurora for more than a season     with proposals of his store becoming an Aurora's outlet instead, but received no reply in that time.  Nevertheless, by  , Aurora was a standout amongst the rising new class of non-guild merchants operating in Waterdeep. \n An Aurora's Whole Realms outlet in Waterdeep held a special sale for adventurers going into   in the late 1360s DR. This included backpacks pre-stocked with supplies and equipment, as well as newly stocked specialist   tools. \n On   in the  , a mysterious man entered the Westgate shop and asked the clerk if her employers were open to   not goods but people between their shops. The clerk relayed this request to her superiors in the central warehouse, and their response was a refusal. The would-be customer thanked the clerk, reimbursed her for her time with a strange idol of a  -like creature studded in jewels, and departed. She described the fellow as mean-looking with fair skin and red hair. The idol was later valued at 3,000   and thought to originate nowhere in Faer\u00fbn. \n Some months later, during  , a fault occurred in one of the   pads in the central warehouse, leading to merchandise being corrupted, spoiled, or flawed on delivery. Upon discovering this, staff issued abundant apologies to affected customers and sent replacements two days later with a 50% discount. The fault was corrected, no evidence of sabotage was found, and the fault did not reoccur that year. \n Unfortunately, the   of the   and after caused a much greater, more long-lasting disruption to Aurora's Emporium operations, with failures in the teleportation network. Amidst that chaos, Aurora's successor and daughter,  , had a difficult time keeping the company together. Much of it was lost, with only a handful of outlets in the major cities remaining in business by the late 1400s DR, among them Waterdeep, Westgate, and Baldur's Gate. \n By the late 1470s DR, Aurora's Emporium was known as a fashionable curio shop in Westgate, run by a greatly aged Aurora. It sold exotic trinkets and treasures from all around Toril:   smoking implements,   cloth;  -feather headdresses from Maztica,   jewelry from  , clothes from  ,   from  , a     and   from the  ,  's pipes, and so forth. \n On   of the  ,  ,  , and   visited the Westgate Aurora's Emporium and met Aurora. Ilira knew her and the two spoke privately, while Myrin noticed   also browsing. \n Still in Westgate, after a century of being shut down, the   in the abandoned   inn had begun to cause instabilities in local magic, which led to interference in the nearby Aurora's Emporium's own teleportation network in the  . To resolve it, Aurora looked to recruit adventurers to reenter Blais House and fix the portals, and maybe even reopen the inn. \n In the  ,  , daughter of Lemily and granddaughter of Aurora, discovered amongst her grandmother's old adventuring finds a map of the abandoned dwarven mines beneath   in the  . On it, she found a note indicating secret treasure and believed it to be the long-rumored untapped rich vein of  , which she thought could fund her plan to re-establish the Aurora's Emporium teleportation network, at least after funding a mining venture. To this end, she secured access to the site and hired adventurers to explore the mines and verify the map and the gold. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aurora%27s_Emporium"},

The result was a heavily fragmented Cult of Ao, one without the support of any affiliated groups or orders within its ranks. Only two sects were known to have outlasted the quick and unceremonious dissolution that took their fellows across  \u2014and, even then, the   cell was secretly puppeteered by the Mad God,  . \n The largest of the cult cells,  the Aoists of   were lucky to avoid such ministrations, unlike their southern cousins. However, as opposed to the typical proselytizing, this latter group was focused on sagely debate, working primarily to uphold   in perceived\u2014if not necessarily affirmed\u2014accordance with Ao's desires. \n Some sects within the Cult of Ao thought it their responsibility to be involved in the affairs of other faiths. By overseeing them, the Aoists ensured that the bounds of a deity's portfolios were respected, and the portfolio itself was actively promoted. Nevertheless, this was not the priority of the entire cult\u2014especially not the Waterdhavian branch. \n Mostly, the cult's cells occupied themselves with discoursing about a variety of important questions. Ao's existence and its implications were a favored topic of discussion amongst the Aoists, and so too was the possibility that the Hidden One, himself, worshiped something greater. Debate regarding the words spoken publicly by Lord Ao, during his first and final speech, was another fundamental question. More grandiose was the one of the world's own origin: who made it, if Ao considered only the gods as his creations?  \n Though celebrated by all throughout Waterdeep, the   was an especially holy day for the local Cult of Ao. Known by the citizenry as  , it was held to commemorate the resolution of the  \u2014the very same day that the Hidden One first made himself known to the people of Faer\u00fbn. As part of the festivities, Ao's cultists sponsored a revel in the Cynosure, lasting the entire day. That same evening, they punctuated the event with a solemn prayer. \n In Waterdeep, the Aoists built and were headquartered in the  . When the building's original namesake made his distant nature clear, though,  the subsequent loss of followers precipitated the loss of the cult's own temple.  The building was bought by the city's rulers, the  ,  and renamed the Cynosure; it soon became a space for civic gathering, and was, sometimes, even rented out for public events. \n Without the Temple of the Overgod, the remaining Waterdhavian cultists were forced to meet elsewhere and in secret, with taprooms and cellars becoming their most common meeting places. Infrequently, their clandestine meetings took place within the Cynosure or even the  , the latter being a temple open to all faiths. \n The Cult of Ao lacked many of the accoutrements common to other clergies,   included. So meager were their assets that, when not engaged in ceremony, there was little way to identify an Aoist from any other individual, for even their ministers simply outfitted themselves in accordance with their quotidian occupations, the weather, or the fashions at the time. \n If it came time to put on their liturgical vestments, however, the cult was prepared. In such a case, the ministers of Ao preferred a two-tone aesthetic, wearing a white shirt atop black pants\u2014all subsumed under a long, broad  . Resembling the one worn by their Lord's  , this last piece was black in color and speckled with star-like sequins or white dots. \n The cultists of Ao accepted any amongst their ranks, from   to  .  The most exceptional among them became known as ministers, equivalent to the   of other faiths\u2014who, themselves, were the only ones prevented from becoming ministers of Ao.  Regardless, it was a meaningless effort, for no true Aoist priests existed. Given that the Hidden One's neglected worshipers were never provided with   or similarly unique abilities,  any member of the clergy who showed such aptitudes likely sourced them from a   or an intruding deity, as with Cyric and the   cultists. \n Despite the regulatory dynamic between the Aoists and the other   clergies, there was little hostility from the latter towards the former\u2014largely due to the cult's lack of authority. Other deities informed their most faithful that Ao never associated himself with mortals. Therefore, because his worshipers operated without their Lord's true support, they were considered no threat at all, not even needing to be spoken out against. \n Spawned in the aftermath of the   of the  , countless people flocked together, eager to worship an Overgod\u2014but they summarily deserted the faith soon after. This apostasy was caused by the fact that their Lord Ao ignored his clergy  , never blessing them with   or answering their prayers. \n Once the novelty wore thin, the Cult of Ao was drastically reduced in number and largely split into regional sects.  The largest and most notable amongst these was a cult based in Waterdeep, the great City of Splendors,  as much of its citizenry had heard Ao himself at the end of the Godswar.  This particular cell that took upon itself the duty of overseeing other, more prominent, churches, and so propagating the decrees of the Hidden One. \n Unpopular as they were, the various cults of Ao eked out a dwindling existence by  , nearly fifteen years after they first formed.  The faith was truly dead by  . After the   and the tumultuous century that followed, none alive still worshiped him and any who professed to be a priest of the Hidden One was dishonest.

She was better known by her business than her face, and it was even supposed she intended it this way, so she could find good products without being recognized.  Despite this, the logo of the company was the face of an attractive woman within a circle; many thought this to be Aurora herself  and in fact it did depict her, but as a younger woman.  At least one portrait of Aurora was drawn by in-house inventor Nadul DaRoni.  As of 1370 DR, she appeared to be in early 40s and had a medium build.  She said she enjoyed wearing jewelry, at least pieces with a storied provenance like coming from a dragon's hoard or a pirate's treasure. \n In the late 1400s DR, Aurora was greatly aged and wrinkled but with eyes that were still keen and bright. She was also elegantly attired in an indigo  . \n She was known to be friendly. \n As a far-ranging adventurer, she grew fascinated by the wide variety in cultures, cuisines, and comforts she encountered and by how her friend Jhegaan interested an audience in his stories of other lands and their luxuries.  She also spent a great deal of time with thieves and enjoyed it and came to like them and their profession, though she conceded this was odd for a business owner. \n In her early years, a practically minded Aurora had little interest in music, thinking it served no benefit. But in her adventuring career, she learned to appreciate its ability to raise spirits whilst on the road and in rough conditions. \n Aurora enjoyed good   and would collect recipes or get loaves to go if she could whilst on her travels. \n Aurora owned and managed her namesake business, which acquired and delivered a wide variety of goods via teleportation to stores all around  . She established stores in new locales, helped receive and fill orders, and oversaw other aspects of the business, including relocation of the central warehouse.  Aurora also penned the introductions to the company's catalog, the  . She used   spells to confirm goods did not originate on the black market.  Despite the scale of its operations, as of  , Aurora continued to run her company along the lines of a small business, thanks to the ease of teleportation. \n The business was founded upon three pillars: acquiring quality items at reasonable prices; selling said items with reasonable profit to customers; and maintaining the good name of Aurora's Emporium, with honorable practices and satisfied customers. Aurora would dismiss any member of staff whom she felt did not keep all three of these principles central to their work, particularly those who bought substandard or illicit goods or inflated prices. \n Despite this, for Aurora, the business was but a hobby, something fun to keep herself active and put her talents to good use; she ran it for personal entertainment, not out of capitalist desire for profit. If she ever wearied of it or found it repeatedly operating at a loss, then she would start scaling back the business, by either reducing operations, shutting down remote outlets, or decreasing quantities and kinds of stock. Fortunately, as of 1370 DR, the business remained prosperous and successful and Aurora was satisfied and still seeking out new and noteworthy goods to stock. \n As a wizard, she was a master of teleportation magic. \n Aurora possessed a number of   collected during her time as an adventurer, but had little use for them as a businesswoman.

It hinted at the location of a lost, untapped   vein. \n Aurora had a daughter   who carried on the family's business, but struggled due to circumstances beyond her control, namely the   disrupting business.

Nevertheless, she could not fathom the appeal of skimpy armor, and once saw a berserker charge into the fray in only a golden belt, only to be defeated in one hit. \n A few years after the group split up and Aurora's retirement from the adventuring life, she settled down but sought a way to stay active, stave off boredom, exercise her skills, and sate her love of exploration, and so she founded her business.  Her first shop was a little place in Waterdeep, named Aurora's Emporium, and it was initially only open for a few days each month after she came home from her travels bearing more exotic goods.  Nevertheless, Aurora made wise investments in the business.  Jhegaan elected to stay and help her, discovering a previously unguessed-at good business acumen himself. \n From such humble beginnings, the business grew and she began to open shops across Faer\u00fbn.  An Aurora's Emporium enjoyed success wherever one opened  and in the early 1360s DR, Aurora reported that she had a new outlet opening each month, promising that there was a good chance that someone reading her catalogue would soon have a store opening conveniently close to them.  Before long, it had become a multi-armed company that spanned the Realms and had agents in places further than even Aurora had traveled.  Aurora once journeyed to  , where she acquired    . \n At some point, Aurora was in   attending an event hosted by Elminster when the gnomish inventor   met her and forcefully insisted his works should be included in  .

Amidst that chaos, Aurora's successor and daughter,  , had a difficult time keeping the company together. Much of it was lost, with only a handful of outlets in the major cities remaining in business by the late 1400s DR, among them Waterdeep, Westgate, and Baldur's Gate. \n By the late 1470s DR, a greatly aged Aurora managed an Aurora's Emporium in Westgate as a fashionable curio shop.

This ability, however, came with limitations. The resulting shape, like its old form, needed a metallic blade that was not infused with magic, nor could it be more than twice, or less than half, as long or voluminous in comparison to the original. Beyond these functional restrictions, there were also aesthetic ones, as the exact appearance or engravings of preexisting weapons could not be replicated. \n Through this ability, a typical   could be converted into a  .

After an approximate minute's rest in its first form,  it was once again able to be affected by the  's power, suffering no adverse effects whether it be repeatedly turned into the same shape or into many different ones. \n Thirdly, the last of a  's external abilities was another transmutative power, one that could affect any sort of object\u2014not just weapons\u2014as long as they were metallic and smaller in mass than a complete   suit. By activating this particular effect, the  's wearer could transform the targeted object into a globe. This particular globe was a hollow one, with a distinct lid that sealed itself through the use of  , preventing any gases or liquids from escaping the globe's inner space. There were limits to the size of the object created by the  , as with its other power, but these were no longer affected by the volume of the original item. Rather, the globe's size depended on the wearer's own physiology. Specifically, the  's upper limit was the size of the wielder's head, whilst its lower limit was that of their smallest fingernail. \n Typical uses of this power included the transport of precious liquids, like water from a magical pool or   blood. Sealing the carry-globe with a flaming object within caused said object to immediately extinguish, and any destructive liquid inside it left the globe unscathed. This was also a longer transformation, lasting two days or until willed to revert. The latter option simply transformed the globe back, unaffected, but if the time limit was passed without the regressive command of the  's wearer, the globe disintegrated into nothingness, leaving any contents to spill. \n  had only one sustained effect that did not first require their wearer's conscious command.  This power made their bodies untouchable to metal, much like the    ,  and so made them immune to prison bars, shackles, or even attacks from non-magical metal weaponry, which could only harm them through supplementary effects like   or extreme temperatures.  Non-magical armor, too, simply passed through them, unwearable.  This particular power did not extend to anything carried or worn by the  -wearer, and so meant that their items could still be trapped and torn by metal that otherwise ignored the rest of the wielder's body. \n This ability also functioned differently if the metal had some kind of enchantment upon it. In that case, the offending object was stopped by a kind of field around the wearer's body, rather than going through them,  which allowed for the use of the   alongside magically imbued metal  .  Weapons were also turned away, though they were capable of damaging the  's wielder according to the power of their enchantment. \n As its name implied, an   also allowed its wearer to transform their forearm into the edge of a   that was sharp and thin.  It was capable of piercing armor and parrying someone else's blade without suffering damage, despite not being metallic in itself, as well cutting through hair,  , and even  , as though the swordarm's edge was recently sharpened.

Although, in this form, the swordarm lacked digits\u2014and so was unable to carry or even grip anything\u2014it could nonetheless be used to support the user's weight and,  ultimately, it was even capable of hurting larger targets more deeply than smaller ones. \n This particular   ability, however, required that the  's wearer wait four days between uses and, even then,  would only last around forty minutes before returning to normal.

During these cold months, several of these towers had to be abandoned as they became too hazardous to live within. \n While Candlekeep did not possess a true government as a village or similarly-sized settlement might, the   of the Avowed were led by a group of their order who ascended the ranks on a meritocratic basis.  While all of the Avowed swore themselves to protect the keep and the contents of its halls,  their leadership made allowances for them to fulfill their duties with structure and order. \n The   was the highest-ranked member of the order, an individual who appointed those believed well-suited to take on leadership roles within.  In all practical applications, their word was considered law in Candlekeep.\n The Keeper was served by the  , who tirelessly worked to obtain new books, scrolls, and other pieces to add to the libraries' collections; along with the Great Readers, eight learned sages that were each considered to be the premier authority in their selected field of study and research. \n They were further assisted by the Great Readers, the Chanter, the Guide, and the Gatewarden.  \n In addition to Candlekeep's absolute rule, forbidding the destruction of knowledge,  Seekers and other visitors were asked to abide by the Orders of Accordance, a set of rules that were enforced by banishment.  Violence, theft, and the damage or copying of any documents in the library's collection was not tolerated under any circumstances. \n Emerald Door The physical defense of Candlekeep's exterior was led by a member of the Avowed known as the Gatewarden. They coordinated the protection of the front gate through which all petitioners and visitors passed.  They were aided by monks known as Watchers, the Keeper of the Emerald Door, previously known as the Keeper of the Portal, who served as the protector of the Inner Ward.  \n Nearly all of the Avowed whose efforts contributed to the safety of the keep were powerful  , like those other individuals that took on leadership roles.  Each of Gatewarden, Watchers, and the Keeper were served by a dozen well-armed monks, armed with a myriad of magical implements. \n Candlekeep possessed ancient hidden entrances, known as 'Old Gates', that were unknown even to the most senior of the Avowed. Passage required precise knowledge of their location, appropriate postures, and utterance of intonations. Beyond these, any prospective intruders would also have to contend with the wards. \n Candlekeep was guarded by layers of     that protected the keep itself, the people within, along with its collection of writings. Among the protections provided by these wards included the restriction of entry by means of  , the preservation of writing from degradation by   or  , an inhibition of flames that were larger than those provided by a  , and prevention of theft of whole  , amongst others.

Recitations of the prophecies were magically recorded within a series of prismatic  , referred to as the Echoes of Alaundo. \n Candlekeep's Chanter and the three Voices were often found carrying out procession throughout the Court of Air, reciting the lines of the  . During these processions, the prophecies of Alaundo continually echoed through the grounds of Candlekeep for all to hear. \n Among the faithful of  , Candlekeep was considered one of the most holy sites in all the Realms. \n To gain entry into the halls of wisdom, a petitioner had to present the seal of a renowned  ,  as well as an \"entrance-gift\" to the library, a   of immense value, great rarity or significant historical importance to add to their collection.  While the shrewd gatekeepers typically accepted books worth no less than 1,000  ,  books containing particularly insightful annotations or journals of important persons have been accepted before.  As of  , requirements for entry seem to have relaxed, and visitors to the library were only required to donate a book, scroll, or similar piece of writing not contained within the library.  \n The \"friends of Candlekeep\" were allowed entrance in to Candlekeep without offering an entrance-gift. Among these select individuals were certain  ,   of the    ,  ,   and  , along with both   and   alike. \n Anyone entering the Inner Ward was required to possess special permission from leaders of the Avowed, in the form of a signed letter that could only be verified by the portal's Keeper. \n Visitors granted entry into the keep were known as \"Seekers\", and referred to as \"goodsir\" or \"goodlady\" by the library's monks, if their name was unknown.  These individuals were allowed to stay for one  , after which they were asked to leave and wait a full month before returning for another stay. \n During their time in Candlekeep, Seekers could read specific books within the necessariums, but were not permitted to copy their contents. Inscription service was specifically provided by the Avowed, with copying and binding costs that ranged anywhere from 100 to over 10,000   and took upwards of several weeks to complete. \n Seekers could solicit the wizened advice of Candlekeep's scholars for the substantial fee 2000 gp, double the standard rate for sages in the Realms beyond. \n Although some sources stated that Candlekeep was originally the citadel of Alaundo,  having grown around his small and humble tower,  the keep actually predated the seer by some hundred years, having been founded c. the  .   \n Alaundo arrived in Candlekeep in the  , to study the writings kept there and got a reputation for his visions into the future.

The only thing to its east, however, was the city's walls, within which the High Palace just barely sat. \n The High Palace inspired the awe of all who looked upon it,  as it was entirely, from its mighty walls to its towers, constructed out of white  ,  a technique seamless enough to appear as if it had all been carved from the same block. The Palace's size also contributed to its magnificence, as it was the largest building in the city, taller than the   and the   both. Its battlements were topped with rearing stone   and unicorn heads,  the shape of Silverymoon's  .  Some of these sculptures were older than the city itself, having originally adorned the bridge of  . \n The High Palace also had four towers:\n The main body of the High Palace itself was reserved for its inhabitants and workers. Most of them, including Lady Silverhand, after she relinquished the title of High Mage, both worked and lived within it. \n The High Palace of Silverymoon was an expansive one, with many rooms to its interior, including:\n The High Palace also had a substantial number of   levels, many of which were unknown to the general populace. Even those privy to plans of the Palace would only know the highest four, which were the only ones ever drawn out. In truth, the High Palace had twelve distinct lower floors. These included, among other things, a tremendous armory, stores of food prepared for winter, prisons, a library of   and Silvaeren history put together by  ,  including her description of the City of Song's fall,  and, outside of  , the most impressive   cellar of the  . \n To most of the Palace's inhabitants, the dungeon's fourth floor, known as the  , was as deep as the lower levels went. As its name suggested, it was the final resting place for many of the city's High Mages. Within it, no one could speak any louder than a strong whisper, but few were given the chance to pay their respects. It was rare for anyone but the deceased rulers' family or another High Mage to be allowed entrance through the   gate at the foot of the Palace's stairs which led into the Crypt. As of the mid-to-late 14  century DR, only seven of the thirteen High Mages that had ruled Silverymoon were buried beneath their city:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Each, upon their death, had their body turned to stone, which was then placed onto a bier of similar material, and further magical defenses were intricately weaved across them to prevent the High Mages from being disturbed. At the foot of their bier was a marble statue, depicting them in the prime of their life and holding their  . The only exceptions to these customs were Truesilver and Orjalun: the former never wielded a  , and so his statue instead carried a  , while the latter mysteriously disappeared, and so no body was placed upon his bier. \n The High Palace's lowest four levels were also more restricted than any other, being accessible only to the High Mage. These deep chambers held treasures of every sort, but, given Silverymoon's penchant for magic and its study, no treasure was better guarded than the historical and literary kinds. Every High Mage, with the sole exception of the tyrannical  , who did not hold the position long enough to learn about them, kept their magical sanctums in these levels; their combined libraries held tomes legendary to even the Vault of the Sages'  . The High Mages also used these levels as stores of magical   and other  , second in the North only to those of   at  . The High Palace surpassed the   collection only in its quantity of ancient Myth Drannan and   relics, but no High Mage since Ederan Nharimlur took any out of the Palace's safeguarded lower levels. \n As the High Palace was, appropriately, the home of Silverymoon's High Mage, they were often the one dictating what life around the Palace was like. In Alustriel Silverhand's days, for example, before its expansion to support Luruan politics, she mostly followed a consistent routine. \n In the early morning, the High Lady Mage would be dressed and made to appear publicly at the Palace's council chambers. There, she dealt with various legal matters, moderated disputes, and dealt with any personal matters brought forth by her citizens. The latter were, however, moved to separate rooms, both for the sake of privacy and added magical protection.  \n Though she only began this custom after shamefully turning away   from the Gem of the North, sometime in  , she never again denied anyone the opportunity to meet with her. Many were either locals of Silverymoon or other inhabitants of the North who wished to meet such a legendary figure. They might introduce their children to her or ask for some wisdom, but so too was she visited by envoys of the  , the  , and even  , the last of which believed they could intimidate her into doing their bidding.   \n Such meetings were beneficial not only to her guests, but also to Alustriel herself, as she could personally study their character and gather knowledge of current events. She was also willing to use such meetings to inform her policies. If it was brought to her attention that certain rules were being obtrusive, for example, Alustriel changed them to make life easier for her citizens and anyone involved.   \n These duties took up most of the day, from early morning to late afternoon, frequently with a break at midday during which the Lady took a private lunch and a public walk around her city.  After the second block of meetings was over, Alustriel retired to her chambers as the Palace prepared for the evening's court. Such an event, taking place around sunset when the city's shops began to close up, would begin with the High Lady, now dressed much more elaborately, announcing any new regulations or commandments, officially receiving any special guests, such as royalty, and allowing further public debates about the city's laws.  These final disputes were kept short, however, and resolved through public forum overnight, so as to start the night's feast on time. \n The High Palace was a heavily guarded building, and it enlisted two primary corps in its defense: the majority were guards and soldiers, all capable of protecting the city's seat of government,  and were known as the the High Guard,  while the rest were spellcasters of varying ability dedicated to the High Mage themselves,  known as the Spellguard.  Both groups, with the mages sometimes accompanied by  , remained on patrol above and within Silverymoon's walls,  but they did not need to patrol the whole Palace, thanks to the   rumored to be guarding it.  During Alustriel's rule, though, the Spellguard, alongside Harper allies, would always eavesdrop and watch the Lady Hope's private meetings during her day-to-day activities, ensuring that she was kept safe.  \n This  , also known as the  , hardly reached a dozen feet (3.6 meters) outside its walls,  and was said to be capable of neutralizing, bolstering, or turning wild the   cast within its boundaries.  Other rumors, however, supposed it simply prevented any spellcasting that wasn't by the High Mage or their Spellguard, or prevented certain   creatures from even entering the grounds. The full truth of its powers, however, was known only by the High Mage. \n Equally strong, if not more so, than the   placed on Silverymoon's gates, the   barred entry into many of the Palace's rooms, both above and below ground, to any who lacked an appropriate  .  For example, venturing deeper than the fifth floor of the dungeons required a token given only to the High Mage's trusted personal councilors and to those most senior and experienced members of the Spellguard. From there, access to the lowest four levels was restricted even further, as the   required a   for a ward token, which was, importantly, only ever given to the city's High Mages themselves.  \n The most powerful of these many   within the Palace made it impossible to cast spells or activate  . Unless wielding an appropriate token, these effects were felt in Alustriel's Gallery and in her private chambers, as well as the Great Hall, the Throne Room, the Councilor's Assembly, and the Crypt of the High Mages. \n The building of the High Palace first started in the  , during the rule of the third High Mage, Ederan \"Catseye\" Nharimlur. Though construction was momentarily interrupted  , when some of the builders were found to be artifact-stealing  , it finished by the end of 766 DR, with the Palace beyond the then-smaller perimeter of Silverymoon's walls.  Only in  , more than a century after its creation, were the city's borders extended far enough to encompass the High Palace. \n In the  , the High Palace became the governmental center of more than just Silverymoon. Though Alustriel Silverhand passed on her title to Taern Hornblade, she continued to reign from the Palace, only now over the entirety of Luruar. Both she and the new High Mage were forced to share the space,  but   across the city made plans, aiming to be chosen to guide some of the Palace's inevitable expansions. \n It was not until the spring of the  , arrived that work truly began, estimated to take   at maximum to finish. This was due to the fact that it was not only the High Palace being expanded but also the surrounding walls and the  , allowing for the creation of a new throne room, matching the   that ruled the city, and of greater space where envoys of the confederation's other settlements could work from and be roomed in.  This last would become the Lady's Annex, within which the Peers' Hall lay. \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/High_Palace"},

With the release of the 2001  , the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings. \n The  's world of Abeir-Toril is but one of several other worlds  in the   crystal sphere. To the natives of Faer\u00fbn, the   above their heads is known as the Sea of Night.  The two closest worlds to the sun in the middle of Realmspace are known as the Dawn Heralds, and they are barely visible only at sunset or sunrise.

Some of these worlds are inhabited by  ,  , and  , but also more sinister races such as   and  . \n The interpretation of the term \"present day\" in the Forgotten Realms depends entirely upon the context in which it is used. Dungeon Masters are free to use the first, second, third, fourth or fifth edition sourcebooks to form a setting for their games of D&D. Alternatively, they may set their games at any point during the Realms' past or future. The   set in the Realms cover a wide variety of time periods too.

Taking place during 1358 DR, the Time of Troubles was a period during which the   of Faer\u00fbn were forced to walk the earth in their mortal   forms. Several major deities died during the Time of Troubles (see  ) and a handful of mortals rose to divinity.  This began a period known as the  . \n The standard starting date for   material is near the end of the  ,  although the timeline steadily advanced to the  . \n The   began in the  , on the presumed starting day of   of that year,  with adventurers published through the   and novels taking place up through the  .\n The end of 3rd Edition was marked by the Spellplague, another cataclysmic event that began in the  , and lasted for  . It was caused by the violent death of  , the goddess of  , and resulted in drastic changes to the functioning of magic, the deaths or disappearance of several deities, and large alterations to the geography of Faer\u00fbn.

This was followed by the full-blown boxed set named the  , released in 1987 and affectionately known to this day as the \"Grey Box.\" 1st edition D&D did not have a great deal of official materials compared to the amount that would follow with 2nd edition.\n The campaign setting was rewritten for 2nd edition D&D and released in 1993 as the  , but later  . 2nd edition advanced the Realms timeline by a decade, after the cataclysmic events of the  . 2nd edition saw the advent of the popular   organized play project in which players could shape the fate and face of an entire city\u2014 .\n The third edition of Dungeons & Dragons was launched in 2000. The   for 3rd edition D&D was a book rather than a boxed set like the two previous editions. It advanced the timeline to 1372 DR and progressed at a steady rate of approximately one month for every two real-world months that passed. \n Because the 2003 edition of D&D was not wholly new and merely altered the 3rd edition rules, no campaign setting was released to coincide with the adoption of v. 3.5. Instead, the   provided an update to the campaign setting to bring it in line with v3.5 rules.

Limited in number, the   ( ) nonetheless maintained a disproportionate amount of power and influence across  .  The church was especially prevalent in the   nation of  \u2014ruled by a   of the faith\u2014where the worship of Loviatar had long been the state religion. \n Occasionally referred to in older sources as   ( ),  the priesthood was historically dominated by women of   or   descent in both number and hierarchical standing.  A disposition towards sadism and cruelty was characteristic of the clergy of Loviatar, who enjoyed inflicting pain upon others and subjecting themselves to it. Their violence was not indiscriminate, however, for the   was highly structured and organized, abiding by a system of strict rules. \n The priesthood of Loviatar was regimented into a variety of roles, each of which influenced the duties they were assigned. Much of the quotidian work at an urban shrine or temple was assigned to  , who composed the majority within the ranks of the Loviatans.  The punishment of transgressors, escorting of prisoners, and safety of the higher-ranked priestesses were instead the responsibility of the  , themselves clerics of the Faith that had shown exceptional dedication. \n Always the first to fight for the sake of their temples, these women tended to collaborate in groups alongside fellow scourge maidens, but they were also known to join   or even depart on divine missions by themselves.  Other clerics instead preferred the path of the  , who behaved akin to an inquisitor. Distinguished by the sheer, black gauze they draped themselves in, these members of the clergy had nothing but contempt for weakness or fear. \n Their duty was to purify, killing anyone they found wanting. This included those who reveled in pain without requiting it and those who were simply afraid of it, but the painteachers\u2014and Loviatans as a whole\u2014could leverage a grim respect for those who received pain unwaveringly, even if they were worshipers of other powers. \n Functioning in a separate branch from the clerics were the   known as  ,  as well as the  ,  who lived itinerant lifestyles. Widely traveled, they were responsible for upholding and enacting the desires of the Willing Whip.  Much like the painteachers,  both could be given inquisitorial duties, but they were just as likely to be covert operatives or simple envoys. \n Although their hierarchy divided them, the pains were regarded with high esteem by the clerical majority, for the former were often instruments of their goddess' punitive will. At any temple or shrine, one to three of these specialty priests could be convened by the clerics.  The maidens of pain, on the other hand, were originally chosen from within the clergy's elite, being women so obsessed with spreading suffering that they became addicted to a drug known as  . \n Beyond these, the Church of Pain also had a place for   and  . The former were usually seen alongside small companies of pains, but the latter group kept to themselves, living in an abbey or   occupied only by other monks. Nevertheless, these abbeys were part of the church hierarchy, which often attached them to a temple that they pledged their allegiance to. \n To make even clearer their hierarchy, the Loviatans also employed a number of different titles amongst each other. The lowest were known as \"Kneeling Ones\", referring to the laity or those who were still new to the faith, but many more were used to refer to confirmed members of the clergy. In ascending order, these were \"Taystren\", \"Adept\", \"Sister\" or \"Brother\", \"Supremar\", \"Caressor\", \"Whiplass\" or \"Whiplar\", \"Paingiver\", \"Whipmistress\" or \"Whipmaster\", and \"High Whipmistress\" or \"High Whipmaster\". \n Some of these titles also had longer, more formal names, used rarely outside of official documentation, disciplinary hearings, or  . In such cases, an \"Adept\" was instead an \"Adept in Pain\", a \"Sister\" or \"Brother\" appended \"in Torment\" to their title, and a \"Caressor\" became a \"Caressor of Terrors\". \n Two additional titles were reserved for those Loviatans who had distinguished themselves uniquely in their service to the Patroness of Torturers: \"Branded\" and \"Truescar\". Only the former had an extended rank in formal circumstances, becoming a \"Branded of the God\". \n The first was used to refer to any members of the Faith of Pain who had reached the pinnacle of their local hierarchy, becoming the head of an abbey, monastery, or temple. The second was instead used for all Loviatans who had adopted a life of itinerancy\u2014frequently heading or sponsoring companies of dark, like-minded  \u2014and spread suffering to extend Loviatar's influence across Faer\u00fbn. \n In those degenerate cities that the Church of Loviatar flourished in, multiple nights and days were spent in debauched revelry,  recruiting members from either extreme of society. Be they the lowest beggars, who starved for anything, or the bored rich, who starved for nothing,  many were known to attend these events, indulging in the     on offer and the flesh of other pleasure seekers, both through dance and other, more carnal, activities. \n One of the ways that Loviatans instilled a sense of discipline in their lesser members was by making them fulfill their tasks in a manner that was deliberately painful or unnecessarily arduous, inuring them to agonies that would have broken someone of weaker faith.  , by the handful, was often rubbed into the wounds inflicted or suffered by members of the clergy, and the faithful were often left heavily scarred by their worship, from past injuries they or their superiors dealt upon them. \n On rare occasions, certain Loviatans, driven by their own restlessness or boredom, were known to enter   and intentionally provoke people into public, violent altercations. However, this was far from common behavior among the faithful. The clergy knew and feared that such overt disruptions, especially in civilized areas, could lead to the persecution of the faith's adherents or its outlawing\u2014as well as the death of the Loviatan instigator. \n Given their reputation and that of their  , Loviatans found that going out in public, even alone during the dark of night, could lead to conflict. Followers of other deities, those aligned with  , were known to ambush them, and even the occasional dock worker or sailor attempted to pull them into a drunken brawl. The faithful of Loviatar, for this reason, were warned to be vigilant, and they developed a habit of always praying for   to use in battle each time they left their sanctuaries. \n The Loviatans also observed a twice-daily ritual, wherein a single, deliberate strike of the   upon themselves was followed by kneeling prayer. This simple process took place once in the morn, and once at night,  but only during the first did they pray to receive their spells. \n Some of the most common celebrations observed by the Faith of Pain were the  . These traditional revels occurred every dozen nights, with the Loviatans circling lit   in a dance, all the while chanting, praying, or singing. Throughout the rite, clergy were intended to repeatedly pass parts of their own bodies over or through the open flames, until the presiding priestess poured consecrated wine over her candle, extinguishing it. \n Though not as frequently celebrated, the   was more sacred than the Candle Rite, and served as the Church of Pain's way to honor the four seasonal festivals. Given its greater importance, the former took precedence if ever the two celebrations fell on the same date. As part of the Rite, the laity were instructed to drum a rhythm accompanying the clergy's ringed dance, which they staged upon thorns, broken crystal, shattered glass, or even barbed  . Much like the Candle Rite, the priesthood sang and chanted as they spun, but they were further encouraged by their more experienced fellows, whose duty it was to whip the dancers. \n Over the course of the Rite of Pain and Purity, a crimson glow slowly rose over the ceremony, eventually gathering into an unsteady cloud above the circle. Notably, this served as a chance for the faithful to directly manifest the Maiden of Pain. For half of an hour, the celebration continued, during which time Loviatar could appear at the center of the cloud to express dissatisfaction, display her favor, or simply to pass on a mission of divine importance. Otherwise, if the time passed without her arrival, the celebration was ended, allowing the Loviatans the chance to heal and tend to their wounds. \n In any fight, Loviatans were fearsome presences. Owing to the unyielding discipline instilled in them by their faith, they became so indifferent to pain that even the most severe of injuries\u2014be they lost limbs or deathly wounds\u2014had no effect on their composure or decision-making. Unshaken by fear of injury or disfigurements, the devotees of Loviatar faced their opponents with a fanatical ferocity, advancing boldly where other, more cautious, adversaries would have retreated. \n In terms of   abilities, none of the faithful of Loviatar were able to  \u2014though her clerics were, instead, bestowed the capacity to  .  The Maiden of Pain further supplemented their stores of   with a few unique ones, such as:\n Dambrath was the largest center of worship for the Loviatans,  so much so that it came to be known as the Nation of Pain.  However, beyond its borders, elsewhere in Faer\u00fbn, the Church of Loviatar most often based itself out of those cities that had grown decadent and overly large. These places, like   and  ,   and  \u2014and even  ,  ,  , and  \u2014were places where the clergy thrived,  with tendrils reaching even into the dark, exotic reaches of  . \n In such locales, many Loviatan temples were constructed of thick   or  , lending them the appearance of a penitentiary or an ascetic monastery, rather than a house of worship; they often went as far as adding barred windows to their clergy's rooms. Below most of these grim temples, vast   could be found. \n Notable temples of the Faith of Pain included:\n Shrines to the Patroness of Torturers were also established, as of the mid\u201314th century  , in the cities of   in    ,  and   in the Vast. \n  Lash of Loviatar  The clerical raiments of the Church of Pain were traditionally worn by adherents of any  , and consisted of shoulder-length gloves, a   gorget, and high boots\u2014all of which were black. These were complimented by a  , customarily slit along the sides. The garment itself could be an identical black or a stark white, but was always lined with a soft, red  , producing glimpses of scarlet whenever the priest or priestess moved. Either atop or below their robes, the Loviatans also wore an audacious   harness across their whole body. \n If sent on an adventure, the clergy were not left entirely unprotected, but their light-weight   was far from the best.  It was pleated and made to resemble  ,  but it offered less protection as it was intended to accentuate the wearer's body, prioritizing style over strength and coverage. Nonetheless, the faithful were proud of it, honored to wear such ceremonial attire. \n Often, the Loviatans supplemented it with a   covered in prongs and spikes, making their pleated armor slightly better\u2014although even this did not make it as sturdy as the standard scale mail. This kind of breastplate was so jagged that a close hug from anyone wearing it could cause damage\u2014an act referred to as the Embrace of Loviatar. \n The Faith of Pain often equipped itself with   and serrated  , but their weaponry, and the   they had access to, increased in quality as they rose in the ranks. A lesser priest, for example, was not typically given access to anything  , carrying only two daggers\u2014one in a boot, another at their belt\u2014and a barbed, 6-foot long whip. This changed if they ever became a full priest, reaching medium rank. \n Then, the clergy member gained access to a  -coated   of black metal and a barbed, 4\u2011foot-long (1.2\u2011meter)  , with the former's handle being hollowed out and used as a container for  . This poison was so powerful that it took effect even through the skin. Enough was reserved to last six strikes after the mace's first blow released the poison, and though it took anywhere from two minutes to five before activating, those who didn't resist it fell deeply asleep. Standard methods, such as cold water or a hard slap, were incapable of rousing the Loviatans' victims, who were put to sleep for forty minutes at least to nearly two hours at most. \n The only ones typically allowed to make use of magic items were the highest members of the Church. While they were most often seen wearing multiple   along their belt, a small number of them also utilized a unique form of the 4-foot-long cat-o'-nine-tails known as a  . Constructed with a   handle and   tails, such   had a certain number of replenishable charges that were slowly drained with each blow. Functioning much like its constituent items, a   appropriately racked its victims with heat, cold, or terror\u2014though, if two lashes struck, the   also unleashed a heinous combination. Of all its effects, only the fear-inducing one could be resisted. \n Most exceptionally, a Loviatan was also blessed with a  , a godsend direct from the Patroness of Torturers herself. Given to those who had inflicted vast amounts of pain and torment, such a   was most often bestowed upon dedicated, outstanding members of the Church of Pain. However\u2014given Loviatar's abiding sadism\u2014they were occasionally also given to good types, those who spread suffering without meaning to. In themselves, the   were mysterious instruments, acting of their own accord to absorb magic flung towards their wielders and, after consuming a certain number of spells, dissolving like melting ice. \n As a whole, the Loviatan clergy claimed a number of unique items under its purview. These included:\n Pain, in Loviatan doctrine, paved the path to many blessings. Only through its experience could genuine pleasure be attained, and only after accepting the sting\u2014and persevering\u2014was true strength found.  The Maiden of Pain enlightened them to the fact that torment pervaded all of  .  Therefore, the most sensible thing to do was to accept such suffering\u2014and, when affronted, requite it as powerfully and painfully as possible. \n Adherents were taught that discipline was at the heart of all punishment, not indiscriminate cruelty. They were to hurt not only those who desired the pain, but also those who would be worst tormented by it, or who deserved it.  They also understood that pain could go beyond the physical, and were encouraged to appear enticing\u2014even a measure of kindness, when administered unpredictably, could be a useful tool to the Loviatans. Though not a virtue in itself, its rare and sudden application instilled false hope, deepening the emotional torment suffered by their victims.  The faithful believed that this heightened what they termed the Mystery of Loviatar's Mercy. \n Loviatar's teachings declared pain from fire, from cold, and from whips as the most reliable forms of agony,  but that any punishments, anywhere, were a chance to preach. To suffer pain was to be tested and strengthened. It was even said that Loviatar herself accompanied any whip, and that she, much like pain itself, was to be both yearned for and feared. \n In the sacred imagery of her faithful, both the Maiden of Pain and her equipment were often depicted in deathly, monochromatic hues. They portrayed her as a slight and ghostly pale figure, bearing a   the color of bone\u2014or alternatively, a   or whip\u2014and adorned in pleated, white armor. \n All mystics and monks within the Faith of Pain were part of their respective orders: the mysterious   for the former and the   for the latter. The Disciples originated in an abbey near the   city of Calimport, capital of  . Besides these, however, the church had no orders of the typical, knightly sort within its ranks. \n The Church of Loviatar admitted many different sorts of people into its ranks, such as monks, mystics, and specialty priests,  but its clerics were the most diverse. Often, they had additional training as wizards, most typically being   or  , as  , or even as proper   if they chose to master the use of their whips. \n These same clerics could also, with the right experience and desire, become  . This granted them access to some of the Church's most esoteric secrets, including the knowledge on how to cast  ,  , and  . Most notably, clerics who had been initiated were able to remain unshaken when others fell to fear and strike more boldly, but they were only capable of this after first suffering an amount of pain. \n Initiation also served as one of the essential requirements for becoming a scourge maiden. This sect, which excluded all but women, was primarily\u2014if not only\u2014available to clerics or fighter-priestesses of the faith, as their skills and training were highly specialized.  Though becoming a maiden of pain was similarly reserved only for female clergy, its requirements were not as stringent. A small number among them had prior training as   or  , but what mattered most was their excessive depravity, which set them apart from most other Loviatans. \n The Church of Pain was also known to foster   in the name of the Willing Whip. Little was demanded of these fanatics, beyond that they be skilled in the use of the scourge and  , but their specific training meant they lost the ability to access  \u2014nor were they able to  , like the other Loviatans. What truly made a crusader of the Church unique, however, was their ability to generate a pain-inducing   once a day. Those who fell victim to it were racked by such agonies that even the simplest actions, as well as attacks, became disorientated and fraught with pain. \n The Loviatans were amenable enough to align themselves with the clergy of other dark and evil powers, but it was not a common dynamic. As a whole, the Faith of Pain only made allegiances if they were first convenient, preferring its independence. In fact, their strongest bonds were ones of utter disdain. \n It was well known that the faithful reviled both the   and  , for their   and   were uniquely resistant to the Willing Whip's torment,  but they especially hated the latter.  Due to the Ilmatari's deepened devotion and cheerfulness, even in the face of pain, the Loviatans targeted Ilmat priests with added hostility, hunting and murdering them whenever possible. \n In turn, many saw the priesthood of Loviatar as an enemy, but they rarely opposed the priesthood directly. The vengeance they brought upon anyone who offended their goddess or tarnished her name was infamous\u2014as was the fact that death, in the eyes of the faithful, was only the most lenient form of retribution. \n Despite this notoriety, some churches had members of their clergy dedicated entirely to combating the Church of Pain. The  , an order of Ilmatari   intent on eradicating the Loviatans, were one example,  as were the assassins known as  , sent by the   to avenge the murder of  . \n Lesser foes of the faithful of Loviatar also included the  ,  as well as those   and  .  To the Faith of Pain, the former were saboteurs, trying to indoctrinate their worshipers\u2014and those of other, dark powers\u2014into the nascent following of the Hidden Lord,  while the latter pair were the mysterious overseers of the  , a fellowship of  . Whenever the full   rose, the felines pursued Loviatans and   alike\u2014but, even so, the group's true motivations were unclear. \n One of the holiest   of the Church of Loviatar came into public knowledge in the late 8th century,   the  . Wielded by a woman known as  , she was a cruel and murderous mercenary of the   who grew in infamy at the head of the  , a company of adventuresses that steadily disturbed the local rulership. \n Their worries only peaked when the Lady Heartless overthrew a   in southern  , installed herself in its castle, and bid renegades as far away as the   and   to join her. Soon, the fledgeling domain of Endrara found itself surrounded, beset by foreign armies. Calling to the Maiden of Pain, Lady Heartless offered a bold arrangement: the salvation of her realm\u2014through delivered priestesses,  , and spells\u2014in exchange for the slow, tortured death of the previous ruler and the Church of Pain becoming Endrara's official religion. \n Loviatar proved, ultimately, amenable. Her faithful arrived from across the whole of Faer\u00fbn to decimate the vastly superior armies, aided by divine, piercing magic that soared through the skies. Many thousands fell to the Loviatans in the conflict,  which was later named the  .  Lady Heartless, however, did not fight, and spent her time torturing her predecessor\u2014a man known as the Jahorgan of Jahorga\u2014by infesting him with parasites, dismembering him, and more. \n These long sessions, during which she acquainted him to a unique whip, proved the first time that history would see and hear of the  .  Even this holy weapon, however, could not protect the nation of Endrara from its next foe. Angered by Loviatar's direct intervention in the form of spells that appeared out of the sky, which he saw as an intrusion upon his  , the   assaulted the domain with storms and floods until it and its people were utterly destroyed. \n The Willing Whip, however, intervened once more; she plucked Lady Heartless from amidst Talos' wrath, rescuing her, and set the woman on a path to proselytize the Faith of Pain. Endreira Chathlass, as she was truly named, became the High Temptress of Loviatar far and wide. The goddess kept direct control over her, causing Endreira's behavior to slowly devolve into  , but she nevertheless preached, tireless and well-travelled, to the people of Faer\u00fbn\u2014most especially, to young women. \n It was during this period that the Loviatans first gained power in the nation of Dambrath. In the  , by betraying the ruling humans in favor of the invading drow, the Church was able to name the half-elven priestess   as queen.  Despite her gradual successes, the High Temptress met her end less than two decades after, in the  . \n During the seventy years she spent dedicated to the Maiden of Pain, she kept the   close at hand. Its unique magic repeatedly proved instrumental when seeking converts, especially as her life became a string of near perpetual degeneracy and bloodshed. Even so, close to 6,000 new Loviatans were personally inducted by Lady Heartless before she was overwhelmed by her old age. \n Unfortunately for the Church, their next leader would not prove to be nearly as long-lived. Ruling for only two years,  , the Chalice of the Faith, saw her possession of the   as proof of her authority; she believed it to be a direct gift from the Patroness of Torturers herself. Though she had lofty ambitions, marking the   as the faithful's holiest artifact, the Chalice Supreme was murdered\u2014strangled to death\u2014in her own quarters  . \n Though no one knew who had smuggled the creature inside, the mysterious culprit was a  . Ishmara's Holy Guard, watchful as they were, only killed it after her own death, before presenting both her corpse and that of the roper to a group of high-ranking, hurriedly gathered priestesses. The pair went unburied, sealed in rooms where they slowly decayed\u2014and, with them, went the  . \n For the Faith of Pain, the next dozen years were chaotic. Until one   finally took control in the  , Imshara's subordinates vied for power amongst themselves constantly. The Sespechan woman, known also as Talons, put an end to the bloodshed and named herself High Holy Temptress of the Faith. She bid the remains of her predecessor be recovered, buried in a black catafalque made of stone, and respectfully buried in  '  , to the south of Endrara's remnants. \n The High Holy Temptress' trials, however, were far from over. During those twelve, turbulent years, another priestess had seemingly stolen the   from its place beside Imshara. A further eight were then spent searching for it, to no avail, as, by the will of the Maiden of Pain, neither her underlings nor any of their magic could locate the  . \n Kathlathtra's search was ended in the  \u2014not due to the appearance of the holy weapon, however. It was due to her death at the hands of  , one of the woman's inferiors, who exploited Talons' weakness in her pursuit to torture the woman until she died, taking her Sacred Throne of Skulls and her title. \n Much later, in  , the Church of Pain saw an influx of worshipers on the  ,  due to escalating raids by bands of both   and  ,  as well as a terrible plague.  The Church of Loviatar gained an even vaster amount of popularity across Faer\u00fbn nearly a century later, during the aptly-named  . The construction of most of the faithful's   temples also took place during that same year, and were still in use by the late 14  century DR. \n One of the clergy, the   fighter-priest,  \u2014alongside a   ally of his\u2014later established the   slavers of Skullport in  .  He was also the one who constructed the Tower of Seven Woes, which became feared even in that cutthroat den of villainy. \n Worshipers of Loviatar were drawn from those who reveled in the suffering of others\u2014the  , the torturers, and the sadists. Her following was not limited to   alone, however; even certain creatures, particularly those who took monstrous pleasure in tormenting their own kind, revered the Willing Whip.

The Harpers involved themselves in many world-changing events that helped shape the course of  's destiny.  Their power and influence waxed and waned over the years, as their order underwent a series of collapses and reformations.  Their reputation amongst the people of the Realms varied just as wildly. They were often seen as wild-eyed idealists, but also just as often seen as insufferable meddlers who could not keep their business to themselves. \n The Harpers as an organization was actually anything but organized. Rather, it was a confederation of individuals from contrasting cultures and backgrounds who bonded over the shared goals of maintaining peace, preserving knowledge, and protecting the downtrodden. Some   worked in small groups\u2014often alongside friends and close allies\u2014while others operated as lone operatives,  who kept only informal ties with the group at large.  Throughout the many years it endured, the Harpers had disbanded and fallen apart several times, only to reform later in some new iteration. \n The Harpers' informality and lack of formal structure lent to its continuance as true secret society.  Some members took on specific roles, such as 'spymasters', 'handlers', and 'agents',  but maintained no hierarchy or ranking over their fellows. It was said that nothing could be truly \"official\" within the Harpers; the group was poorly defined, with contradictory operational standards, no formal roster, and a public face that was inconsistent from one locale to the next. \n There did remain one consistent representation of the Harpers across the Realms, however: their symbol. The Harpers' symbol comprised a silver   and crescent moon, set upon a field of black or royal blue. \n For much of its history, the Harpers were separated into two branches, each of which operated on either half of Faer\u00fbn's  . The western branch of the Harpers\u2015the  , headquartered in  \u2015maintained a formal hierarchy, and orchestrated far-reaching plots many months in advance of their execution. The eastern branch\u2015known as the   or  , based out of  \u2015preferred instead to sponsor parties of young  , wielding subtle influence rather than taking direct action.  Both branches strived to achieve the same goals, and regularly shared intelligence with their comrades across the Realms. Beyond their operational differences, the collective members of the two branches each held contrasting attitudes and world-views. \n For a few decades, there existed an offshoot branch of the Harpers, known as the  . This splinter sect acted separately from the two branches of the Harpers, operating in the sprawling metropolis of  ,  and at times undermining the efforts of true Waterdhavian Harpers. \n The only true leadership of the Harpers was a small governing council known as the High Harpers. They were responsible for setting and planning most of the group's long-term plans and goals.  Members were elected through the means of secret ballots among the other High Harpers, with the criteria of long-term service and extreme discretion in the execution of their plans.  One of the High Harpers on the   was   of  , who was granted the title sometime before the  . \n While the Harpers held no formal hierarchy, some members did enjoy the distinction of being named  .  These select few were blessed by the goddess   and bestowed with   associated with the Goddess of Magic and other deities that were present at the  .  This term was sometimes confused with the unofficial name of the Harpers' eastern branch, the so-called  , though usage in this manner was generally discouraged. \n If a Master Harper was slain or otherwise died with an unfinished quest or charge, they returned to the Realms as a  .  These incorporeal,   Harpers retained the powers they held in life,  serving the order as immortal guardians over the aptly named 'Harper haunts'. \n Among the Masters Harpers were four of Mystra's immortal daughters,  ,  ,  , and  , as well as two of the goddess's favored  ,   and  . Other known Master Harpers included: \n The Harpers believed in the power of the individual over that of the sprawling kingdoms with laws that oppressed individual liberty. They sought to maintain balance between all things, civilization and nature, societal order and personal liberty.  They considered the   city of  , with its rich culture, celebration of the arts, and promotion of education to be the most ideal expression of this balance by the free peoples of the Realms. They sought among other things to spread that belief, and recreate the world in the lost city's image. \n While they strived to eliminate tyranny and foster \" \" in the Realms, not all Harpers agreed on how it was defined.  Despite these differences of opinion, they did share the belief that current events could only be fully understood with a comprehensive knowledge of the history that preceded them. \n Considering the vastly different backgrounds and cultures from which Harper members were drawn, each cell or individual agent maintained their own, unique outlook on how to best conduct Harper business. Generally speaking, they took care of how their actions affected the greater world. Senior members tended to act with caution and circumspection, while younger Harpers often believed it was upon them to personally make the world a better place.  Yet all members were taught to uphold the virtues of dedication and comradery and honestly assess their own shortcomings. Harpers knew they could only earn respect not by attaining power or holding lofty titles, but by demonstrating sound judgement and acting with integrity.  \n Some enemies of the Harpers accused them of treating their more manipulative schemes as some sort of grand game, that the people they directed were mere pieces on a   board. The Harpers demonstrated a type of altruistic arrogance, insisting that their machinations were taken for folks' own good and the overall betterment of the world. \n Harper agents were determined individuals. They never quit on their missions and took however long was needed to see them to completion.  If an agent was slain in the field, their comrades would never forget their sacrifice and vowed to bring justice to their killer. \n It was said that the secretiveness of the Harpers extended beyond the organization as a whole, trickling down to its individual members and their personal lives. While often boisterous and lighthearted in public, Harpers tended not to share genuine sentiments with others\u2013save for occasions when they were alone with their comrades. \n Overall, the Harpers were one of the most tolerant factions of the Realms. They accepted people from all walks of life, even those with unsavory pasts,  so long as they swore the Harper Code and did not violate its tenets. \n The code of the Harpers was a series of outwardly simple statements that were in truth exceptionally difficult to maintain in earnest. They were not written down in any   or tome, but were expressed as a series of 'watchwords' used to swear in new members, an occasion known as the  .  In the late 15  century  , however, the Harper code was written in a book, upon which new members would swear their oaths. They would keep a copy as reminder. \n The Code of the Harpers, or the Harper Code, was as follows: \n In summary and practice, it meant to oppose tyranny and evil; to protect the oppressed; to maintain freedom, peace, and order; to support fair and just laws; and to prevent extremes and imbalances of power, wealth, influence, and opportunity.  They should do whatever they must, no matter how mundane or boring; no matter how hard, uncomfortable, or demeaning; and no matter how risky or life-altering.  They were expected to help one another without hesitation or concern for cost  and to ask nothing in return for the works they did.  They could freely disagree with or criticize each other, and were to police their own and punish treachery.  Finally, they were to accumulate knowledge for the good of everyone and to record and preserve the past,  for it was said that history provided the light with which a Harper could see the future ahead. \n Throughout the course of history, the code of the Harpers spread beyond its members, influencing the shaping the laws of cities across the Heartlands and  . \n Conducting Harper business consisted of scheming, subtle nudging, and more than a little manipulation. More often than not, they helped guide events of the Realms rather than acting as their direct cause.  Harpers tended to work as discreetly as possible, preferring the weapons of knowledge and influence, rather than those of more violent means. \n So that the balance between civilization and the natural world could be maintained, the Harpers acted to keep kingdoms small and minimize the destruction of animal and plant life by   or others.  To that end, they cultivated public gardens and regularly re-planted crops in the wake of war and other crises.  \n To preserve the knowledge of the past\u2015and thus keep secure present and future prospects\u2015the Harpers readily shared their wealth of knowledge and lore with the common folks of the Realms,  often through music, stories, and song.  They never altered their performances to agree the whims of those who held power, but kept their works true to the tune of history.  When necessary, they used their performances to convey secret messages to allies and warn them of nearby dangers.  The simple alteration of a single chord or substituted phrase in a well-known folk song could instantly inform others to heed their warning. \n When the threats of destruction and tyranny presented themselves, the Harpers took decisive action. They moved against evil cults, thieves' guilds, and other malevolent forces that terrorized the people of the Realms.  Agents protected innocent folk from monstrous beings that sought to destroy civilization,  defended the weak against careless or malicious practitioners of  ,  and kept at bay the horrors of the  , by sealing off passages that linked it to the surface world. \n The Harpers operated either individually or in small, close-knit groups. Senior members who wielded significant influence\u2015known as spymasters \u2015directed and aided young adventurers\u2015known as Harper prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u2015who took on quests that furthered the Harpers' interests.  Yet other veteran Harpers lived the adventuring life themselves, taking it upon themselves to complete those very quests for the betterment of Faer\u00fbn. \n Special Harpers known as handlers served as intermediaries between spymasters orchestrating events, and other members completing field work. They were more often deployed in cities and regions that were considered more perilous for an agent's safety and well-being. \n Most Harper agents lived some form of a double life.  They went about their business for much of their day, earning an honest (or not-so-honest) living in town or in the wilds, all while closely observing the activities of others. They took careful note of gossip and local tales, and compiled that information with that given to them by fellow members.  They put on their best outgoing and charming personas, in order to get from others the most significant insights and information possible. Agents were of course allowed to pursue other interests outside of the organization, so long as they did not violate the Harpers' code. \n Whenever possible, Harpers made most of their moves outside of public view so they could not be tracked and studied and they acted \"behind the scenes\" either in places of power or at opportune moments.  They analyzed power dynamics within a realm and took action when needed to prevent power imbalance or stop one faction from achieving domininance over others.  These techniques were how Harpers ensured the greatest chance of success during their missions; it was on occasions when agents revealed themselves and acted openly that the group committed its greatest blunders.  \n Known amongst their own as \"weaponless Harpers\", some lived as spies as informants  often under aliases as traveling performers.  Some others acted as political manipulators and information brokers, working with commoners and merchants to spread rumors in aid of the Harpers' cause.  Yet others fed intelligence to their more foolhardy comrades, focusing on deception and subterfuge over steel and spell.  \n In order to correct economic disparities that were prevalent across the Realms,  \nthe Harpers were known to occasionally rob wealthy nobles and merchants, in order to redistribute their wealth to poorer folk. If needed, those agents took some of their ill-gotten gains for themselves, to finance future Harper operations.  To further support other members, the Harpers employed a network of drop boxes, hidden caches, and safe houses, at which their agents could find communiques, supplies, or even a safe place to rest.  It was believed there were at least thirty such drop-offs in the city of Waterdeep alone. \n Individual Harpers agents often used the grand, boisterous   celebrations sponsored by the   as occasions to meet with their comrades. \n Members shared information with each other in myriad ways, often employing magical means of communication or employing allies as intermediaries.  \n Elder Harpers developed their own form of non-verbal cant, known as  .  The Harper sign language dated back to the years before the  , and fell into disuse during that era. \n The Harpers also employed a secret, rudimentary language of  ,  each of which had a unique meaning to other Harpers. These runes were inscribed at certain locations to warn, attract, comfort, or otherwise notify other members\u2015or anyone else that knew their meaning\u2015about nearby dangers or local support. To mislead their foes, this system included extraneous marks that only other agents would know how to interpret and know to disregard them. \n They also utilized a series of passwords and code words to facilitate secret communication. Some of the known words and phrases included: \n Some Harpers received magical   of the group's harp-and-moon symbol to allow themselves to be clearly identified by allies. These appeared as innocuous, mundane tattoos at first, but transformed into the Harpers' symbol when the proper   was spoken. \n By all official records, the Harpers organization maintained no real base of operations in the Realms.  The operations of the Harpers' eastern branch remained largely decentralized,  while the hub of its western branch,   in Berdusk, was the nearest thing the group had to a true headquarters.  Founded during a time when the  , Twilight Hall served as a reminder of the Harpers' origins along with the reasons for which all Harpers were willing to fight. \n  was an island stronghold somewhere in the   that was used in the late 1400s to store an assortment of valuable   and powerful and dangerous   taken from the foes of the Harpers. Only a Harper, that is, a bearer of a  , could enter. \n In the hinterlands of the Realms, elven allies and devotees of the nature deities maintained safe spaces for their friends among Those-Who-Harp. Known as  , these locations were kept secure and secret from non-Harpers and were protected by powerful   enchantments. \n In the so-called \"civilized world\", the Harpers stationed agents in many prominent cities, smaller towns, and even isolated hamlets all across Faer\u00fbn and beyond. They operated mainly in  , along the  , within the   and the  ,  and the  .  \n By the 15  century  , the Harpers were active across all of Faer\u00fbn,  and beyond. They had even set up operations on other  , such as their place in the  's  , within the  . \n Harper agents were active in many cities across the Heartlands.

The   in   and   were two of several secluded Harper safehouses situated within the great forest of  .  Harper members were among the few non-elves granted safe passage through the ancient forest,  many of whom made pilgrimages to Harpers' Hill to take some time for contemplation and self-reflection. \n The western branch operated primarily out of Berdusk,  and maintained safehouses and conducted operations out of  ,   ,  ,   ,   ,  , and  .  They were freely welcomed in the   city of  , the sole remaining home city of Tel-quess during the  . \n In the northern region of  , Harpers operated out of  ,  ,  and  . \n The Harpers carried out operations in many cities in the political hotbed of  ,  including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  .  They were forced to take much caution when conducting business in the   and  ,  as those realms were home to the   and were the center of the   and later   faiths.  They kept agents in the cities of  ,  ,   ,  and at least one   in   itself.  In the overtly hostile  , Harpers operated out of  ,   ,  , and the imposing port city of  . \n As the Harpers were vilified in the nations of  ,  , and  ,  it was only fitting their agents remained alert and active, especially in the region's more influential and politically volatile cities. Harpers were known to operate in the capitals of   and  ,  as well as the settlements of   and  . \n In Waterdeep, the Harpers maintained a secret headquarters near the base of   known as  . Throughout their history, the Harpers maintained anywhere between seven  and approximately 120 members within the city's walls at any time. The Harpers held significantly less influence in the City of Splendors following the formation of the Moonstars,  but did also operate in the subterranean city of  , in the bowels of  . \n They had numerous agents coming in and out of  , utilizing the   as their safe house within the city. \n The Harpers conducted a number of operations in and around   over the years.  They became more active after the city was nearly destroyed in the mid\u201515  and were repeatedly imperiled by several warring factions.  Neverwintan Harper agents could find refuge within the  , a tavern in the  . \n They maintained another safehouse in the farmlands near  ,  and another in the form of  , the famous way stop situated along the  . \n The   was among the safest locales in the Realms for Harpers to stay. The city of   was home to  , a favorite site of natural beauty among the Harpers,  and  , a well-defended tower that served as one of the Harpers' few official meeting places.  They freely operated out of of  ,  home of the Harper stronghold known as  .  It was within Moongleam Tower that the Harpers maintained a crucial   that linked to additional circles in cities across the North. \n Harpers offered shelter and aide to travelers all across the wildlands of the North.  They also had agents stationed in the settlements of  ,   ,   ,  ,  ,  and  .  They had a safehouse in  , the   on  ,  and a sanctuary in  , beneath  . \n Beyond these regions of major Harper activity, agents also conducted official Harper business in  ,  maintained a pair of safehouses in the   city of  ,  and were rumored to hold an outpost in  , a   settlement in the  . \n The Harpers organization was one with significant resources and a surprising amount of wealth. As a whole, they maintained financial investments in holdings and establishments across  .  The collective network of artisans, craftspeople, and merchants within their ranks allowed agents of the organization to purchase valuable   at a significant discount, helping increase the chances of success for their missions. \n Harpers across the Realms could be identified by the small, treasured token that became a symbol for aiding the downtrodden: the  . Each of these badges proudly displayed a silver crescent moon and harp, and possessed potent   powers,  but varied depending on its creation.  In broad terms, they were crafted in   and   variations.  Pins were carried at all times, except during missions where the exposure of their identity might interfere with its success. However, they would only wear them openly  when needing to be recognized by other Harpers,  when at Harper meetings,  or when in Harper bases. \n  were small pieces of jewelry that possessed minor  , bestowed upon individuals that performed a service for the organization. Crafted from  ,  , or other precious materials, they were often embossed with symbols favored by the Harpers. \n Traditionally, Harpers had no uniforms, both to maintain secrecy and to avoid needless pride.  However, by the 1400s DR, some Harpers donned dark blue-green hooded   attached with their   over their armor for use within their bases or in situations where they needed, or wanted, to be recognized. \n Harpers crafted  and employed a variety of magical  ,  , and other items that were invaluable in times of danger. Notable among these were  , which helped agents withstand mortal wounds and escape unharmed,  and  , gems of illumination that were linked to a single individual.  Preferred weapons of the Harpers were   such as   and the unique,  ,  along with  ,  and unique, Harper-crafted blades known as  . When drawn, these enchanted greatswords let out resounding songs that bolstered the morale of their wielders and improved their combat prowess.  Some two-score Harpers across the North were bestowed powerful   that were crafted by the one-time Harper and Open Lord of Waterdeep,  . \n A   was a magical scroll that caused   to magically transform into actual harps for a short duration. \n Over the centuries, Harper craftspeople and   had made some of the finest instruments in the Realms, appropriately often in the form of magical harps. Notable among these instruments were  ,  ,   ,   ,  and  .  Many Harpers' favored  , enchanted harps that could be held in one hand. \n When Harpers were  , several of those present were blessed by the Seven Gods of the Dancing Place,  deities that chose to manifest themselves on   on the momentous occasion. Later designated as the  , these select few were granted unique powers,  not unlike those bestowed upon the divine  ,  each associated with one of the Harpers' patron deities.  Notable among those deities were  , the Lord of All Glyphs;  , the Lord of Song;  , the Lady of Joy; Mystra, the Goddess of Magic; and  , the Lady of Luck. \n Later in the Harpers' history\u2015sometime after the  \u2015these boons became available to members outside the handful Master Harpers,  namely to   and  . Notable among these powers were:  \n Experienced Harpers learned how to  , and do so once each day. As they furthered their career, they could perform the feat more often. \n Due to the bond formed with Mystra upon their founding, along with the numerous powerful   that held membership amongst their numbers, the Harpers possessed knowledge of numerous spells that were not commonly known by casters in the Realms.  Notable among these were  ,   ,   ,   ,  and  , among others. \n The Harpers regularly worked alongside the   to maintain the history and cultures of the lands they loved.  Strongholds maintained by the Heralds served as hubs of communication for the Harpers, being sites where they could safely leave mail for fellow agents to receive later on.  \n The group known as the   was founded by former Harper  . He called together leaders of some major powers in   to standardize their use of heraldic arms and prevent miscommunications that could adversely affect commerce in the region. The High Heralds remained staunch allies of the Harpers and worked alongside them on missions of shared interest. \n They counted among their allies some of the more prominent  , including   in Silverymoon,  and the   in  .  They were also allied with many of the   that established themselves across the North,  such as the  .  Political bodies and military orders, such as the  , the   the  ,  and the  , were aligned with the Harpers' mission to maintain order across the Realms. \n Other groups that the Harpers counted among their allies included the  ,  the  ,  the  , the  ,  and even the   of  . \n Many gods supported the organization of the Harpers: the churches of  ,  ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   \u2015including the Mystran   and  \u2015as well as the  ,   ,   ,  ,  ,  Tymora,  and the entire   all contributed   to become members of the Harpers and many of these also lent divine aid to members of the group on a regular basis.  This could cause tensions between individual clerics of different faiths but never between deities or between society as a whole and deities.  \n My hatred burns for those who harp \nThey work against me at every turn \nAnd when I hear them harp at twilight \nMy soul in me doth burn. \n Powerful individuals supported the Harpers, but equally powerful forces opposed them. Among these were the likes of the  ,  the  ,  the  ,  the  ,  the  ,  the  ,  the   of Westgate,  the  , the  ,  the  , the  ,  and the   of  . \n The factions with which the Harpers were most often in conflict however, were the  ,  the Zhentarim,  and churches of numerous dark gods, in particular the revived  . \n The one organization in Faer\u00fbn with the most complicated relationship with the Harpers was a splinter organization known as the Moonstars. Founded by ex-Harper Khelben Arunsun,  the sect differed greatly in their collective outlook on how to accomplish their shared goals,  but often still worked hand-in-hand with traditional Harper members.  On other occasions, the two groups operated as rivals of one another. \n The Moonstars nearly completely fell apart following the death of their founder, with only a few select members of their inner circle continuing their work in the subsequent decades. They experienced a brief, but astounding reappearance in the Realms during the events of the  , before once again going silent.  \n Accurate knowledge regarding the founding of the Harpers was said to be rather nebulous, and the history of the order overall was so convoluted that Elminster referred to it as \"The Hidden Tale\".  The original concept of the the Harpers was first conceived in the fabled city of Myth Drannor, by elven military leaders that worked in collusion with a few trusted human   and  .  The     agreed to lead such a group in the  ,  at the head of a council that also included a (relatively) young Elminster Aumar. They took for their symbol Mistwinter's family crest\u2014a silver harp between the horns of a crescent moon\u2014and met at twilight at secret locations in the  , earning them their moniker: the  . \n The Harpers at Twilight dwindled in number over the next four centuries, victims of attrition at the hands of their enemies: bandits, slavers,  ,  ,  , and evil spellcasters attracted to Myth Drannor's success.  The final blow to the fabled City of Song was struck in the  , at the culmination of the   when the   overwhelmed the defenders of Myth Drannor. In just  , more than half their number was lost.  By the end of the conflict, Dathlue herself was slain,  killed alongside a dozen of her fellow Harpers-at-Twilight. \n On the   in the  ,  a large congregation of   arrived at the   druid grove in  .  Their arrival occurred at a time when dusk fell earlier than it should have and a bright moon shone when no moon should have been visible. The dryads bid the druids welcome the prizests of many different gods who started to arrive before finally Elminster appeared to explain why they had all been called. \n The elves had called for the support of the priests assembled to help fight back against the faithful of  ,  ,  ,  , and  , who were coming from the south and attacking the elves and performing abhorrent deeds.  The priests argued but their deities\u2014 ,  , Mystra,  ,  ,  , and Tymora\u2014directly possessed them and spoke through them, voicing their support in person and extending their blessings to this effort.  This night thus became known as the  . \n The remaining Harpers-at-Twilight set about recruiting new members and expanding their influence, though they did so very slowly and lost around twenty new recruits to conflict with their enemies.  Over that time though, these new Harpers established an incredibly effective information network, and earned the respect of religious leaders by using that network to help their causes. In return, they were granted the use of fortified temples and   wherein members could train and recuperate between missions.  \n The next few centuries were known as the \"Long Years\" within the organization.  During late 9  century, in the  ,  the Harpers erected the wards around   to prevent   from overwhelming the surrounding lands.  While the protections unfortunately lasted for only a few years,  the Harpers spread rumors that attracted local adventuring groups to help slay the fiends that made it out of the ruins. \n Some decades later, in the  , Harpers worked with   to slay  , founder of the Cult of the Dragon.  The Harpers' increasingly public actions brought them into more frequent conflict with the church of Bane and the nation of  . \n In the  ,  the Harpers founded the   to prevent the unscrupulous from blaming others for their misdeeds. The Heralds also used their power to provide Harpers with cover identities. \n When the Harpers eradicated the   and drew the ire of the  , the Lord of the Dead's followers dispatched   to seek out and assail the Harpers.  The undead spellcasters were turned away and subsequently destroyed. The church then raised armies to hunt down them and the remaining Harper agents. The Harpers were finally forced to go underground in the  . \n After the loss of many members during the previous year, Elminster and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun decided in the  , that new recruits were needed and that the revitalized Harpers would be an \"underground army of adventurers\".  Recruits who met the pair's standards took time to be found, but eventually Elminster happened upon the  , a band of a dozen  , druids, and rangers led by   and   in  . Through a series of manipulations, these adventurers were introduced to surviving Harper veterans and ended up successfully battling many of the Harpers' enemies. \n The fates aided the Harpers in these efforts in the  , when they acquired significant treasure after successfully delving into the lair of the undead dragon  , and destroyed the mighty  . They used their newfound riches to make wise investments, purchasing properties and buying up businesses in cities all along the Sword Coast. \n The group continued to be quietly manipulated by Elminster and Khelben, who appointed certain members as \"Master Harpers\". These Harpers received directions from the duo, via dreams bestowed on them by Mystra, that led them to a cache of   in  . Elminster then traveled across the Realms with two of Mystra's children, the sisters   and Storm Silverhand, to bolster the ranks of the Harpers. They posed as traveling minstrels, cultivated an air of mystique about the order, and attracted new members with their music. \n Over time, the Harpers re-established their information network but were drawn into ever more public fights with evil churches, the Cult of the Dragon,  and the nation of Thay, and other malign forces.  Casualties began to mount again and, to avoid a repeat of history, Khelben and Elminster had all senior Harpers go into hiding.  \n At some point, the legendary Harper bard Finder Wyvernspur was corrupted by his own vanity and hunger for artistic immortality. The \"Nameless Bard,\" as he was known, was put on trial before the Harpers, who found him guilty of   and imprisoned him within the  . \n In the  , seeing the Harpers no better than cultists of Bane, the Heralds decided that they could no longer be openly associated with the Harpers and split from them. \n Meanwhile, junior members grew tired of the new, low-key direction the group was headed in and started getting themselves killed in foolish fights. In the  , Elminster gave them a unified direction\u2014by pulling them into his ongoing conflict with malaugrym, horrific shapechangers native to the  .  The Harpers' ongoing secret war with the malevolent   came to be known as the  .  Only around forty of the Harpers involved in the war survived it and when they returned, they found their organization had strayed in a completely different direction. \n A Harper bard named   had convinced himself that Elminster, Khelben, and the Harpers they'd taken with them during the Harpstar Wars had gotten themselves killed fighting on other   and that senior Harpers in hiding had actually permanently retired. His ambition, therefore, was to replace the organization's leadership and reshape it to his own ends. He desired to be the power behind every throne in the North and while planning how to achieve this he happened to meet one  , a Red Wizard of Thay. \n The two came to an agreement: Szass Tam would funnel Rundorl information on his rivals in Thay and Rundorl would gain prestige by sending Harpers to win victories over them. To justify this focus on Thay, a land previously neglected by the Harpers, Rundorl spread the story of \"the spell of Undeath\". According to information he'd 'discovered', the Red Wizards were developing a new spell capable of instantly turning the populations of whole cities into undead slaves with a single casting to quickly produce armies and threaten and enslave all of  . According to Rundorl, the only things stopping them were some issues in implementation\u2014and the Harpers. The plan went perfectly, Rundorl led and sent his fellows into battle against those Red Wizards and even   whom he claimed had involvement in \"the spell of Undeath\" and both he and Tam advanced in power. \n Eventually, though, more Harpers were dying than Thayans and Rundorl led a reluctant retreat out of Thay. His exhausted men were being assassinated and reanimated as undead, however, and Rundorl rightly suspected that Tam had betrayed him. Rundorl broke off the alliance, then appealed to another lich named  . He promised the Harpers' services in return for his help defeating his reanimated comrades. Thavverdasz agreed, but then dominated Rundorl's mind and read his thoughts, mockingly took for himself the name \"Harper King\" after learning of Rundorl's ambition, and made the man his undead minion. The undead Harpers were easily wrested from Tam's control but Thavverdasz betrayed his other allies, the Cult of the Dragon. \n It was this situation that the surviving Harpstar veterans encountered when they returned to Faer\u00fbn in the  . The Cult of the Dragon had raised an army and sent it against Thavverdasz's Harpers while Szass Tam challenged the Harper King directly. Thavverdasz used a powerful magic item to defeat Tam, but Elminster surprised and assassinated the Harper King shortly thereafter. \n Grimly, Storm and Dove set about replacing their massive losses while Khelben and the remaining veterans licked their wounds.  Elminster pulled strings among the   in   to keep the Thayans busy and turned the lair of the Harper King into a deathtrap to destroy the inevitable Cult of the Dragon reinforcements. Luckily, the Harper information network remained intact and largely ignorant of the organization's recent corruption. \n In the  , the Harpers helped defend the great city of Silverymoon, when it was threatened by a rampaging hoard of orcs.  An apprentice of the city's High Mage by the name of   was appointed as Silvermoon's new ruler, but only served for two years before abandoning its people.   after Sepur's ascension, the   of orcs assailed the city, while warlords and mages vied for rule over the city. Master Harpers Storm and   led the Harpers in a   in defense of Silverymoon and emerged as a heroes of the city. Alustriel was elected by the Silvaeren people to rule as High Lady Mage. \n In gratitude for the Harpers help in defending the city, Storm Silverhand was granted permission to build Moongleam Tower in Everlund. It was around that time that Storm took on leadership of the Harpers'  . \n It was in the  , that the Harpers first received intelligence about an emerging threat in  \u2014the Zhentarim. Over the course of the next century, the Harpers and the Zhentarim would all but wage war on each other. Each faction seemed to gain an edge for a time, before the other struck back once again.  While Khelben took over as leader of the Harpers on the Sword Coast,  Elminster was left to counter the Zhentarim threat alone, engaging in a long-standing feud with  .  \n However, in the  , Khelben sponsored the Harpstar veteran   in her bid to become High Lady of Berdusk,  and gave over to her leadership of the western branch of the Harpers. The Harpers of Twilight Hall, as they were colloquially known, acted openly against the Zhentarim and   interests and even came close to crippling the Rundeen.  While these actions brought on open hostilities against the city of Berdusk, they also attracted many folks to join the Harpers organization, swelling its ranks with new members.  \n In the  , Harper agents managed to put an end to the Rundeen's financial stranglehold over  . They disrupted the organization's major operations in Calimshan and killed three of their leaders. \n They suffered tremendous loss a few decades later, however. In the  ,  \u2015eldest of the  \u2015and several Harpers were slain when a   was called down upon Faer\u00fbn.  But her   persisted in the mortal world as one of the group's famed  , and would appear when summoned to certain Harpers in times of peril. \n . In the  , the   struck Faer\u00fbn when the gods above were forced to walk the Realms as mortals. Amidst the numerous conflicts and catastrophes, the Harpers fought to defend Shadowdale against the invading armies of the  , particularly in the  .  Elminster and the spectral Sylun\u00e9 led a band of Harpers in a series of skirmishes against the   and his sect of the malaugrym.  These events however led to many deaths among the ranks of the Harpers. The aftermath of the crisis saw the return of Finder Wyvernspur to the Realms and his subsequent rise to godhood. It also led to much disruption among the Zhentarim, which brought enough of a reprieve for the Harpers to replace their losses. \n Over the following decade, the Harpers engaged the Zhentarim in skirmishes across Faer\u00fbn. They fought an open war against the Zhents in the  ,  and helped unite the   people against Black Network agents in the oases of the   desert.  A  , Harper agents were systematically tracked down and slain by an individual known as the \"Harper Assassin\". In time, the Harpers discovered the deaths were the work of a   who had been working in league with the Zhentarim.  Conflicts between the two groups broke out in cities across the Heartlands, from   to   and even  . \n While the Harpers remained engaged in conflict with nefarious groups, it was observed by some they had been failing in their role as lore-keepers for quite some time. In the  , the disgruntled former Harper  \u2015who subscribed to this belief\u2015used a   to curse the Harpers, altering the tales they told and ballads they sang. She focused her vengeance against the city of Waterdeep and its archmage, Khelben Arunsun. Fortunately for the storytellers and balladeers of Faer\u00fbn, her plot was foiled by Khelben and his Harper apprentice  .  As misguided as it was, Iriador's message was received in earnest by the people of Waterdeep. Soon after these events they refounded the bardic college of   in the City of Splendors. \n That same year the Harpers were forced to face off with the Cult of the Dragon yet again, in a series of engagements that culminated in a massive battle in the city of Elversult.  They struck out against the cult a few years later, working to prevent the cult from establishing   as the monarch of the politically unstable nation of  .  \n With the downfall of Bane and the rise of  \u2015and its subsequent entanglement with the Zhentarim\u2015new foes developed evil plots to which the Harpers could not ignore. Harper agents acted against the followers of the Dark Sun as they sought after murderous artifacts on the Sword Coast,  and chased down   in order to bring him to justice. \n In the  , the Harpers were able to put an end to a major threat that imperiled much of the North. Their members utilized powerful magic to destroy Hellgate Keep, and send back to the Hells nearly all the   that remained within. \n The Harpers were not safe from strife, however. In the  , investigators discovered evidence that implicated Khelben in the theft of an  , the  , which had then found its way into the hands of the Zhentarim. Khelben admitted to all of the charges set against him. Khelben and Laeral both left the Harpers,  along with Alustriel, who felt she could not uphold her commitment to the group, as High Lady of the  .  and many of Khelben's closest friends and allies, founding their own group: the Moonstars. \n The government of Waterdeep refused to help the Harpers of Twilight Hall prosecute Khelben, so the Harpers proceeded to ward their stores against Khelben and Laeral, while Khelben erected a ward that prevented any Harper from approaching  . Influenced by  , the Harpers of Twilight Hall went on a witch hunt to purge their ranks of perceived traitors while Storm's eastern branch tried to carry on with their business regardless of events in the west. \n When the church of Bane reformed with the Zhentarim\u2014following the wane of Cyricism and the   to godhood\u2015the Harpers were once again targeted by agents of their longtime foes.  \n The Harpers were overwhelmed as a whole during the  , a series of disasters that followed the   that wracked the Realms in the  . Many Harpers died while others vanished. Those who survived were cut off from one another, so they focused solely on the perils that menaced their homes and neighbors. While the original organization was divided and its members scattered across the continent, the hope of returning the Harpers to their former glory didn't die. \n One bastion of Harper strength remained, however: Moongleam Tower. As of the  ,   re-founded the group as the \"Harpers of Luruar\" to secretly counter the forces of returned  , hoping to keep the Harper ideals alive.  Following their example, other Harper cells formed throughout the Realms. Some of these groups were collectives that adopted the Harpers' name and traditional ideology, while others comprised former Harpers that had survived the collapse and had gone underground before returning to action.  Notable among the latter were the \"Harpers of Waterdeep\" and Storm Silverhand's \"Harpers of Cormyr and the Dales\", which many felt were the spiritual successors of the original organization. \n Several other groups who called themselves Harpers appeared in the following years. The \"Harpers of  \" worked against the   and other Amnian authorities, but although they claimed to share the ideals of the Harpers of old, they did not and merely claimed to in order to gain support. The \"Harpers of Selgaunt\" and the \"Harpers of Ormpur\" were also rebels who did not really cleave to Harper ideals.  These new Harpers brought with them enemies of their own, such as the  , Szass Tam's Thay, the Zhentarim, and the   of  . \n At some point, Harpers seem to have acquired or stolen  the   that had been used by Szass Tam to turn much of the population of Thay into undead servants some years before \u2014not unlike the false \"spell of Undeath\" story spread by Rundorl Moonsklan before the rise of the Harper King.  They stored it within the vault of Korinn's Keep, far from the lich's reach. \n By the  , the \"Harpers of Luruar\" had managed to cripple the efforts of the Netherese in significant ways.  Unfortunately, Eaerlraun was killed by shadovar assassins and the Harpers were forced to act in complete secrecy to prevent the loss of more members.  \n Within  , the Harpers of Waterdeep were led by a Harper agent known as  , who was actually a double agent working for the Zhentarim to undermine Harper operations. Although   and other Harpers were able to bring the Fisher to justice, he did great damage to the Harpers of Waterdeep. Even after  , Zawad was still dealing with corrupt Harpers within his Harper cell. \n The Harpers of Neverwinter also suffered a devastating blow that same year. The group's leader   was in the middle of aiding the   openly oppose the rule of  . Cymril was slain when her group was ambushed by  . After the attack, it was revealed that she was also working for Neverember.  After her treachery was revealed, the reputation of the Harpers of Neverwinter significantly tarnished for some time. \n In the time of  , in the  ,  Storm Silverhand began to revitalize the Harper organization in Cormyr. She sought out people from all walks of life: smiths, merchants, leather workers, and even those who worked in brothels. Her revitalizing actions were known and tolerated by the   of Cormyr.  The Harpers prevented the assassination of King's Lord   who was sheltering  's lady,  .  Since then, the Harpers became an active organization across the Realms again. \n In the years following the  \u2014which occurred over the course of the 1480s DR\u2015the Harpers bolstered their numbers, recovered their resources, and once again embarked upon secret missions to better the Realms.  The network of spies and adventurers held no leadership as before, but remained scattered across the breadth of Faer\u00fbn. They focused their efforts on their long-standing mission to oppose tyrants and other purveyors of injustice. \n The Harpers in the Moonsea region began investigating a series of raids and kidnappings in Hillsfar and the surrounding farmlands.  They successfully helped foment rebellion in the city, to overthrow its cunning First Lord,  .  Meanwhile, in Hillsfar, they became aware of strange happenings in the Underdark.  They helped forge an alliance between the people of Hillsfar and the drow of   to meet the emergent danger of   and other prominent  , all appearing on Toril at once. \n Yet other agents began looking into rumors circulating about a new iteration of the old Cult of the Dragon.  Rather than worshiping dracoliches, the new dragon cult devoted itself to  , the evil Queen of Dragons. When the cultists attempted to bring their goddess to the  , in the 1480s DR, the Harpers were among the many factions who rose up to oppose Tiamat's attempt at freedom. Their agents tracked cultist activity across the Sword Coast,  gathered leaders of the free cities in the  ,  and fought alongside their allies in the final assault of the   fortress. \n During their involvement with the Dragon Cult's schemes, the Harpers began to keep a closer eye on its strongest allies: the Red Wizards of Thay. The Red Wizards had made strong inroads into the North and the Sword Coast during their alliance with the Cult.  On one mission in the mid\u20131480s DR,  a trio of Harpers captured a Red Wizard in his treasure-stuffed lair. Among them was the recent recruit  ,  who stole a   token, little thinking it might be magically marked. By tracing that gold,  four Red Wizards rode into   seeking revenge and murdered Edgin's wife  . Afterward, Edgin blamed himself, abandoned his oath to the Harpers, and burned his   of the Harper Code upon Zia's funeral pyre. \n Some years later, the cults of   arose in the   and the  , and were a threat to the people in and around those lands. The Harpers were among the factions of the west that acted against the cults, working against the   in Mulmaster and their activities in nearby mines. \n When the   of  -kind was abolished in the latter half of the 1480s DR and giants of all kinds ran amok in the North, the Harpers went on alert to protect the towns and cities they called home. \n Some years later, the   struck the Realms, and   could no longer bring back the   of the recently deceased and restore their bodies to life. Around that time, the Harpers of   in Chult worked alongside the   to uncover a hidden foe within their city.  Working with other groups, they established a base of operations in the jungles of Chult and began to investigate a possible source of the curse.  They finally determined the curse originated from an unholy and otherworldly artifact known as the  , hidden deep within the jungles of Chult. \n They once again took actions against the ever-meddling Red Wizards of Thay, who had uncovered an   that was infused with the dark energies of the  . The Harpers set up a secluded safehouse within the city's ruins, and collected intelligence by spying on the malign spellcasters from Thay.  Harper agents successfully freed the many slaves the Red Wizards used to uncover the lost city, and uncovered their plot to take control of the   within. \n In the mid-1490s DR,  ex-Harper turned thief Edgin Darvis betrayed the order by leading a band of thieves, including himself,  ,  ,  , and  , to Korinn's Keep to steal its reaches. For this robbery, he donned his old Harper uniform and  . They triggered an alarm and fought with Harper guards, but Sofina betrayed the thieves and escaped with her prize\u2014Szass Tam's  . Edgin and Holga were left at the scene of the crime and captured by the Harpers, convicted of crimes of skullduggery and grand larceny by the justice of the Lords' Alliance, and incarcerated in the   prison.  Two years later, Sofina would be revealed as a Red Wizard of Thay and servant of Szass Tam, and used the   in an attempt to transform Neverwinter's population into undead servants of Szass Tam, but was thankfully foiled by Edgin and his thieves. \n While the Harpers regularly sponsored adventurers looking to prove themselves, the group maintained high standards for accepting full-fledged members.  Admittance into the Harpers was more often initiated by the group rather than the individual,  requiring sponsorship by a member in good standing,  and approval of the High Harpers.  Recruits would be assigned a first mission, with silent accompaniment by a senior member, who did not make their presence known to the prospective agent. \n Members could quit the Harpers and foreswear the Code if they wished, such as after a loss of faith in its ideals,  though the organization still kept tabs on ex-members, as they would under the Code.  A career in the Harpers was never expected to last long, however, often being cut short by retirement or a more unfortunate fate. It was not unheard of for dying Harpers to bestow their final, incomplete quest upon a trusted ally or new friend. If that ally successfully carried out the dead agent's last quest, they were brought into the Harpers as a full member in good standing, without argument or trial. \n Membership could be revoked from any member if they violated the Harper's code, purposefully or negligently endangered a fellow agent, or willfully turned away from the organization. Readmittance into the Harpers was possible if an individual personally petitioned the High Harpers and agreed to undertake a quest of great importance, as well as completed some manner of  . \n Harper adventurers came from many walks of life.  They held nearly every profession, though more than a few lived as merchants or  ,  and served at any age, young or old. Harpers could be of any  ,  and of any race.  It was noted that more women than others were found among the ranks of the Harpers. Humans, elves, and   were the most commonly represented races, but some  ,  , and  , and even woodland folk like   and   also joined.  \n Most members of the Harpers lived their lives as resourceful   or captivating  , .  though some dashing  ,  mighty  ,  stalwart   and   of benevolent deities served as well.  Throughout the Harpers' history, numerous   had also joined its ranks. These unique   had the power to tap into the Weave through song or dance. \n Priests could follow any faith;  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and the   were all represented. This caused no issues of faith, though there was some friction with upper ranks of clergy.  , particularly of the North, tended to be their willing allies rather than members. \n One of the more decisive battles fought during the Weeping War came to be known as  . While nearly all the information regarding the fighting was kept hidden as Harper lore, it was believed that nearly seven out of ten Harpers in Twilight Hall were slain during the length of the two-day battle. \n The \"High Harp\" badge of   referred back to the   of the Harpers at the Dancing Place. \n During the mid\u2013to\u2013late 14  century DR, there persisted rumors about a second Harper Hall that was to be founded in  , called \"Ravens Hall\". \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Harpers"},

He was also considered one of the Realms' most preeminent  \u2014whose name was known from the  , to the far-off jungles of   and the   of  \u2015  as well as the favored   of  , Goddess of Magic.  Over the course of his centuries-long life Elminster had saved people of Faer\u00fbn from destruction or subjugation on numerous occasions,  and earned himself legendary reputation among its people. \n Elminster's most notable feature was his hawk-like nose, which distinguished him since his youth,  throughout the  ,  and well into manhood.  He had a shock of stark black hair in his youth,  and maintained a beard through most of his years that eventually went gray in his old age.  El had vibrant blue eyes set under big, bushy eyebrows  that turned blue-gray later in life.  \n In his later years, the elderly Elminster began to show his age, with his gruff voice and weathered features, but remained alert. He preferred to wear plain clothes,  like simple black or gray  .  \n While Elminster was capable of taking on almost any appearance imaginable,  even that of a   he once slew,  he often preferred to travel in a less conspicuous manner, often utilizing   and   spells. \n Depending on the circumstances, Elminster could be as equally serious, fearsome, or arrogant, while just as often demonstrating exceptional charm, cleverness, and good-natured humor.  At all times he was said to be wholly fearless and entirely forthright with others.  El was a natural raconteur and actor, and could take on the role of father figure, a wily trickster, an immoral rake, or any other clich\u00e9d role that served his needs at the time, or else on a whim to elicit a reaction from others. Most often Elminster chose to only reveal the full range of his character to his close friends and companions. \n Elminster extolled the virtues of tolerance, peace, and freedom from oppression. He truly cherished the wonder and beauty of the natural world.  While El grew up hating magic, especially those that wielded it for their own selfish ends,  he garnered a profound appreciation for   and   during his studies. According to El, mages should further their studies to best understand how to   using the arcane power they had their disposal. \n One of El's personality quirks was that he snored loudly while sleeping. He was considerate enough to magically mute himself during sleep if it would disturb his friends. As one of Mystra's Chosen however, Elminster did not actually need to sleep. \n , a baked fowl dish, was one of Elminster's favorite foods found in the Realms, second only to fire-seared   or  . \n Before he devoted his life to the   or began his wizardly studies, the young Elminster possessed the innate ability to heal himself  and detect magical auras at will.  El was exceptionally intelligent\u2014a gift that was bolstered by multiple castings of the   spell.  He was also blessed with an eidetic memory,  that allowed him to recall information from years past in quite an impressive manner.  \n Elminster's memories may not entirely have been his own, however. It was speculated that some of his remembrances were implanted in his mind by Mystra, to best facilitate his transformation to the instrument of her will that the Realms truly needed.  Regardless of the veracity of his memories, El considered his exceptional memory as something of a curse. He couldn't help but remember  the death of every friend and loved one, along with every tragedy he could not prevent over the thousand-plus years of his life. \n According to  , Elminster's singing voice was entirely tone-deaf,  despite its rather \"nice, smoky baritone\" quality. El was also known to be a poor musician, incapable of writing down music himself,  unskilled in  ,  and an exceptionally bad horseman.  He was, however, apparently quite skilled with a needle and thread. \n Elminster's areas of expertise as a sage included a robust understanding of magic, familiarity with a wide range monsters, a deep knowledge of history, and comprehensive familiarity with familial genealogy. \n Elminster was rumored to have learned much of his understanding of   from  , a mage who died in   some five centuries before the  .  By that time in history, El had gained knowledge of every   that was commonly available to most adventuring spellcasters in the Realms.

He also held mastery over magic that shaped the elements of the natural world.  El was familiar with powerful and esoteric spells only known to select few spellcasters, including  ,   ,  and  .  He was also one of three individuals confirmed to know spells capable of recharging   gems. \n While he was selective in his usage of  , El was proficient in a number of its  .  \n As one of Mystra's chosen, Elminster was granted numerous spell-like abilities, including resistances and immunities to a myriad of spells.  He also had the ability to wield the goddess's  ,  and channel  \u2014pure raw energy taken directly from   itself. \n As was the case with at least one other of her chosen, El was designated as one of Mystra's  , which were locations or individuals that tethered the Weave to the physical world. \n Elminster was seldom one to travel without his staff, large pointed hat,  or one of the numerous pipes in his collection. He had several notable pipes, including one made of   that usually puffed vile blue or green smoke,  and his famous  ,  that could float independently and allowed others to take on his appearance. \n The Old Mage owned a variety of powerful  , including an  ,  , a  ,    and  , numerous  ,  a  ,  and a  .

He saw himself as a caretaker of the Realms,  and more often than not something of a meddler,  who always strived to preserve its long-term health and prosperity over any immediate threats that arose. \n Following his \"retirement\", Elminster continued to gallivant across  ,  but did spend more time in seclusion at   in the  .  During that time of his life, El was less inclined to speak to visitors or other strangers that came by his \"humble abode\".  \n In addition to his residence in Faer\u00fbn, Elminster maintained a hideaway within a floating metal sphere that orbited the central   of the planet  ,  along with extra-dimensional   referred to as  . \n Elminster was credited with the invention of several unique spells, including  ,   ,  ,  ,  and  .  \n Elminster penned a number of   in his time including  ,   , and a  .  His personal journals led to the creation of several published works, including  ,  and the  ,  while stories of his adventures inspired both  ,  along with others written by   and  .  He left a copy of   on another world, Adenthia, where it was a legendary artifact.  He also claimed to be a playwright who authored at least one popular play titled  . \n At least one of El's   had been made available for aspiring adventurers to learn from, the one entitled  . \n El famously compiled a nine-book series titled  , in which a number of contributors wrote about the plants, animals, creatures, people, and other natural phenomena they'd encountered throughout the  .  His name was attached to a work titled  , found in  , that in fact housed a carnivorous   creature.  The often-circulated  ,  , was also often erroneously attributed to him. \n El crafted several powerful magical items over the years, including the first ever  . \n Elminster was so famous across the Realms that he had at least one drink named after him, a dark beer from   known as  .  El himself was not a fan of the brew.  He was even immortalized as both a wooden nesting doll and a   piece, as offered by  . \n Having once ventured within, an echo of Elminster remained within the   library in the  . It was known to have appeared in the Archives of the Future. \n While El's parentage and family were known to few,  he was in fact born to   son of  , one of the seven Princes of Athalantar, and  , daughter of a woodsman.  El was believed to have had many lovers over the course of his life, and sired at least one child,  , the 'Silken Shadow' of  .  He was also the great-great grandfather of  , a     and thief. \n Elminster counted upon many friends and allies throughout his life, from his fellow thief  ;  to long-time ally and friend,  fellow  ,  and often ideological rival,  .  He was colleagues with many prominent sages, scholars, and spellcasters, including   of  ,    of  ,    of  ,  and   of  , among many others.  El was also considered a friend by nobles and royalty from all across Toril and the planes beyond, including Regent   of Cormyr (even after her death),  Count   of  ,  and the Dragon Lord   of the   pantheon known as the  . \n The Old Mage held friendships and acquaintanceships with his peers from other worlds, most notably   on  , to whom Elminster told much about Faer\u00fbn while enjoying refreshments (the Sage of Shadowdale was particularly fond of pi\u00f1a coladas).  Elminster was also an aquaintance of   and   of   and   of  ;  the three frequently met at Greenwood's home on Earth to exchange spells and news of each other's worlds,  though Elminster would never have dared admit it to other Torillians. \n He was connected in purpose and creation with all of Mystra's other  ,  and maintained communication with them by means of a telepathic link.  He held a particularly strong bond with Mystra's own daughters, known throughout the Realms as the  .  He helped raise three of them from childhood\u2015 ,  ,  and  , \u2015the latter of whom took the name 'Storm Silverhand'. Over time, Storm became El's favored traveling companion,  and the pair nurtured their bond as kindred spirits for centuries. \n Elminster maintained strong bonds of friendship with other good-aligned and scholarly minded individuals. El was dutifully served by  , his personal scribe  and Royal Consort to Queen   of  ;  he regularly edited works written by  , author of the widely popular but seldom fact-checked \"Volo's Guide to...\" series of travelogues;  and maintained an amiable yet friendly rivalry of sorts with  , the Mage Royal of  .   , a Wizardess of  , was Laeral's and Elminster's friend but shared no love for Alustriel Silverhand in the late 15  century DR. \n He was an ally of numerous  ,  including the  ,  and the  ,  and was even considered a 'bloodbrother' to no less than five clans of  .  The dragon named   was amongst Elminster's friends and allies in the late 15  century DR. \n Elminster continued to take on apprentices on occasion. Notable among these were   \"Wolf-beard\", the mage and merchant;   ;   , who accompanied Elminster to   when the city's   became resurgent;   , a longtime scholar of the  ;   , who attempted to steal from the Old Mage but was subsequently destroyed at a  ;  and  , who witnessed Elminster defend himself against two   from  . \n While El did not originally take on a young Vangerdahast as an apprentice, the Old Mage did share with him some arcane secrets, which remained secret between the two friends. \n Not all of Elminster's apprenticeships ended well. By Mystra's request El began tutoring  , one of the goddess's other Chosen who went on to found the  . The relationship between the two mages quickly became contentious. Sammaster left Elminster's tutelage after his obsession with Mystra and jealousy of her lovers overwhelmed the young mage. \n Elminster eventually stopped taking on new students for a time. His decision stemmed from the fact so many young mages were corrupted by the ever-present drive to attain more powerful magic and to use that magic to wage war. \n Elminster enjoyed many romances during his long and storied life,  but his first and arguably most impassioned lover was the goddess Mystra herself.  The two spent much time together when El was a young man (as well as when El, now Elmara, was a woman), during the time Mystra walked the Realms as  .  He was flirtatious and amorous with numerous members of the Fair Folk and their kin, including  , the Lady of  ;   , a   from Cormanthor;  and the  , a unique  -like being that watched over  . El and the Srinshee enjoyed a centuries-long friendship,  founded on mutual admiration and shared respect for the nature of magic.  Their friendship endured the years despite the Srinshee's one unsuccessful attempt to steal away from Elminster some of his  .  \n The second great love of Elminster's life was  , the Witch-Queen of   and the second-youngest of the Seven Sisters.  Their passionate romance formed during the early 14  century,  after they met and famously battled one another in a spell-duel some decades prior.  The love they shared continued on for well over a hundred years, enduring the death of  , and the calamitous series of events that followed. El remained dedicated to Alassra during her darkest years, and did everything in his power for decades to keep her well when she was afflicted with supernatural madness. \n Among Elminster's greatest foes were   and the  ,  terrible shapeshifting beings native to the  .  Elminster had slain one of their kind as a youth,  and earning the distinction of being their \"Great Foe\"  after helping thwart an invasion of Toril.  Elminster later assailed the malaugrym at their   and exterminated nearly all of their kind. \n Perhaps Elminster's most distinguished and menacing foe native to the Realms was the    , founder of the nefarious  .  Their various encounters ranged from farcical, when Elminster' embarrassed Manshoon in front of the   of  ;  to deadly, when Manshoon killed Elminster at his weakest point;  to tragic, when Elminster finally   what he cherished most. \n He was one of several prominent spellcasters targeted by the murderous members of   of  , who had placed a 10,000   bounty on his head.  Elminster had even earned the enmity of the Red Wizard  , before his apotheosis to   in  . \n Elminster was born in the  ,  to   and  , lord of the village of   and prince of  .  When he was just a boy, El's parents were slain and his village was decimated by  , one of Athalantar's malevolent  .  Left as the only survivor of the slaughter,  the young Elminster took his father's broken blade, the   that served as a symbol of the   of the Stag Throne, and found a new life foraging for himself. \n El was rescued by   and taken to live with the outcast  , who had meted out their own form of justice as brigands out of   in the  .  He remained with the outcast knights for a few years,  until the killing he was forced to enact in defense of his home took its toll. At only sixteen years old, Elminster had already grown weary of death and knew he needed to find a new livelihood. \n Leaving the life of banditry behind, El set himself up as a burglar in  , capital of Athalantar. He operated under the alias of   and befriended a young thief named Farl.  They committed many terrific and exhilarating heists together and lived their lives to the fullest. They later formed a gang called the   in opposition to the rival  , who were servants of Athalantar's magelords.  During one burglary, Elminster met the   of Mystra,  . Dorgon asked El if he desired to learn magic, but Elminster refused as he hated all mages because of the magelords. \n While Elminster enjoyed his time spent as a thief in Hastarl, he rededicated his efforts to seeking revenge upon the magelords for the death of his family. When he ran afoul of the magelords' temple in the city, El was overcome by hostile guardsmen and saved by Mystra herself. The Lady of Magic transformed him into a woman named   to strengthen his bond with magic and to expand his understanding of the world.  For a few years, \"Elmara\" served as a priestess of Mystra in Athalantar and beyond.  After some time, Mystra appeared to El once again as Myrjala Talithyn and trained her in the ways of spellcasting. The two became dear friends, and fell in love with one another. Over time however, Elmara felt compelled to \"reveal\" to Myrjala his true identity as Elminster, and shared his quest to take back Athalantar from the malevolent magelords. As an avatar of Mystra, Myrjala of course was fully aware of El's shared identities. \n Elminster and Myrjala set out together,  rallying allies from among the   of the  ,  the exiled Knights of Athalantar,  and the Velvet Hands of Hastarl.  In the  ,  Elminster and his friends stormed Athalantar's capital city, defeated  , the Mage Royal that slew El's family, and reclaimed the Stag Throne from his uncle  . \n But Elminster had no desire for kingship, and quickly abdicated in favor of his friend,  , honored knight of Athalantar.  After a night of revelry and celebration, Elminster and Myrjala departed the kingdom. On their way out, however, Undarl revealed himself as one of the   from a different   and attacked them on the road out of the city. Myrjala's magic was ineffective against the otherworldly creature and she appeared to die from its spells.  To prevent Elminster from foreswearing the use of magic, Mystra revealed herself to Elminster and proposed that he become one of her Chosen. Elminster readily agreed. \n The  ,  Elminster traveled to the city of   to continue his magical studies with the   under Mystra's direction.  He walked east from Athalantar, across the   and through eastern border of   before arriving at the  .  While in the forest, he unsuccessfully tried to defend a   from  . With his dying breath, the elf bestowed upon El the   of  , along with the mission to return it to his family in Cormanthor. \n en route When he arrived in Cormanthor, Elminster was astonished by the city of elves.  He did however keep his promise and returned the   to its rightful owners.  While many elves treated him with animosity and outright hatred,  Elminster was brought before Coronal   and Mystra blessed their meeting with her presence.  El was taken to the   to face a trial with the being known as the Srinshee. The two  , becoming fast friends and bonding over their shared outlook and appreciation for magic. With the Srinshee's blessing, Elminster was openly welcomed as the first human granted permission to dwell in Cormanthor,  named   (or elf-friend),  and granted the title of   of the   by Coronal Eltargrim. \n However, those that opposed opening Cormanthor to non-elves tried to use Elminster as proof that   and other undesirables were detrimental to elvenkind,  and framed him for murder.  Despite the allegations, El garnered some respect among the forward-thinking elves of the city,  recognition that was bolstered in part due to Coronal Eltargrim and the blessing of Mystra.  Eventually, Elminster was apprenticed to a cruel and powerful wizard from   known only as  ,  and compelled to toil away for 20 years under oppressive conditions.  \n Despite the poor working conditions, Elminster's made significant contributions to the formation of Cormanthor's first  , which protected the city from outsiders. While some sought to subvert El's involvement in the   ritual, and twist it to their own political aims,  the raising of the   was a momentous occasion. The   was completed in the  , and the newly renamed city of   was opened to non-elves for the first time in history. \n Unfortunately El could not find true peace in Myth Drannor and attempts on his life continued. On   of that year, Lady   attempted to slay the Old Mage, first by lacing his   with   poison, and when that failed, attempting to kill him with spells. She was ultimately unsuccessful and was subdued by a greater mage. \n Elminster remained in Myth Drannor for nearly a century,  and was present in the  ,  when Lady   founded an order of idealistic elves, humans, and   known as the  , which would aid the city's defense.  The group's   symbol was chosen by Elminster\u2015ironic, given his poor ability with the instrument.  \n Elminster finally left Myth Drannor at the behest of Mystra in the  . He had spent about 90 of his 120-odd years living amongst the elves of  . \n On   evening in the  , the Srinshee visited Elminster one last time after claiming the  . She briefly interrupted his studies to bid him farewell before she departed for  . \n Elminster returned to Myth Drannor and fought in the city's defense during the  . El joined the conflict about four months after the   first laid siege to Cormanthor in   of the  . He fought alongside the   and contributed to the elves' victory in the conflict known as  . Months later, he fought again in the legendary  , which saw the Army of Darkness driven from the city. Elminster himself destroyed the   that linked Myth Drannor to  , but was inadvertently sucked into other   and lost to his allies for some time. \n After the tragic loss of the city, Elminster joined those in attendance of the   at the   in the  .  This momentous occasion saw the clergies of many   of nature, along with those of the  , assemble together in unity against the agents of those whom they referred to as the 'Cruel Gods'. It marked the re-founding of the Harpers organization. These adventurers would act in defense of the good people of the Realms, while holding no allegiance to one single deity. \n Some thirty years later, in the  ,  Elminster awoke within a dusty tomb when a band of adventurers found their way within. He was under the impression he had been trapped there in stasis for roughly a century. How he came to believe this was unknown, given recent events in the prior decades, though it was believed by some that his  . \n It was around this time that Mystra decided to take a more personal hand in the creation of her Chosen. She chose  \u2015the mortal man she deemed most worthy\u2015and his paramour   as the vessels to birth seven daughters over the following years. \n Shortly thereafter, the god Azuth came to Elminster, telling him that he mustn't rely on Mystra for aid like any of the other Chosen must do with magic. El was presented with another test from Mystra: he would have to learn to survive without divine aid while using magic as little as possible.  He was directed to serve under the tutelage of a wicked sorceress named  , who served the god Bane, and sought to tempt El away from Mystra's path.  El apprenticed himself to Dasumia,  and was eventually named Court Mage of   under his new malevolent Master.  As Dasumia tortured innocents and prepared a ritual for her dark god, El was compelled to take action. He refused to strike down her victims as directed and attacked Dasumia with what minimal magic he could cast. In the end, Dasumia revealed herself to be the goddess Mystra herself, once again testing El and his faith. \n Around that time, magic had become unreliable and   appeared whenever spells were cast. Some began to panic and speculated about whether Mystra still lived.  Elminster was drawn to an ancient repository of magic created by the      ,  where he freed the long-imprisoned Spellcaster  . Saeraede enticed El with powerful magic that had been forbidden by Mystra,  and attacked him,  before being slain herself by   from El's past. \n After all he had gone through, Elminster felt dejected and lost. He reiterated his faith to Mystra and prayed to the goddess in earnest.  El was given visions of all he could have had in life had he not devoted his life to his worship, saw everyone he had lost over the past 500-odd years, and even witnessed the arcane power he could have, had he chosen to take it for himself. In one of El's darkest moments, Mystra appeared before him and stated his most important task was just ahead:  the rearing of her daughters. \n By the  , Dornal and Elu\u00e9 had seven daughters, but tragically Elu\u00e9's mortal body could not handle Mystra's divine possession. When Dornal learned that Elu\u00e9 was in-effect possessed by a supernatural entity, he tried to murder her and then abandoned his daughters.  Mystra entrusted the care of  ,   , and   to her most trusted servant Elminster for a time.  After two of the girls found their own paths in life, Elminster dedicated himself to raising only Laeral. \n Decades later, in the  , Elminster first met with Sammaster, a fellow Chosen of Mystra. El took on the young mage as an apprentice for a time, instructing him on how to wield his newfound powers, including the highly coveted  .  But over time Sammaster developed an unhealthy obsession with  , Mystra's second eldest daughter, and lost command over his  . In the  , Sammaster and his apprentice   abducted Alustriel and prepared a horrific ritual that would steal her access to the fire and restore his own. Elminster and Alustirel's sister Laeral rescued their fellow Chosen and were forced to slay Sammaster, leaving his remains to Mystra's consort  . \n On   in the  , Elminster confronted   for attempting to control  . During the ensuing battle, the Srinshee advised Elminster through his silver fire on how to defeat the elven mage. \n In the early 11  century DR, Elminster and Khelben Arunsun spent much of their time searching for suitable adventurers to take up the mantle of the Harpers of some centuries past. In the  , they found the champions they sought in the form of the newly chartered company known as the  .  After the group firmly established themselvs as a force of goodness in  , Elminster ceased his meddling with the group, at least for a time. \n By the 12  century DR, Elminster had become well versed in traveling the various planes of existence. While visiting the Plane of Shadow, El inadvertently attracted the attention of a malaugrym \u2015the same type of aberration that had posed as the Mage Royal of Athalantar \u2015and slayed the being.  When others of its kind descended upon Toril, Elminster drew them into a battle at   in the  , and rallied his Harper allies to turn them away from the Realms.  \n Despite warning them never to return, this conflict gave way to the  , which began in earnest in the  . During the conflict, El crafted the eponymous   a magical device that helped his allies learn more about the aberrant monstrosities from the shadow plane. The Harpers fought the malaugrym across numerous extra-planar locales, and both sides of the conflict suffered tremendous losses. It was only when El's comrade Khelben Arunsun took over the consciousness of the malaugrym  ,  in the  , that the war came to an end.  After some 40 years of fighting, only a handful of malaugrym remained in their own  , along with a score of Harpers that returned to Toril to help protect the Realms. \n While Elminster and his allies were away from Faer\u00fbn, a mediocre bard named   had taken control of the group and named himself the 'Harper King'.  After drawing the Harpers into a drawn-out and pointless conflict with the   of  , Rundorl began to lose control of the situation and was forced to ally himself with the    , an ally of the emergent Cult of the Dragon,  which itself was founded by El's former pupil Sammaster.  As the Red Wizards, Harpers, and Dragon cultists entered into a terrible battle at the  ,  Thavverdasz battled the Red Wizard   and appeared to claim victory as master of the undead. Elminster appeared out of the skull of a slain Harper and destroyed the lich and saved the remaining Harpers, just having returned to Toril with his comrades. \n Despite their \"victories\", the Harpers as an organization was left nearly in ruin. Elminster transported his injured friend Khelben and the other survivors to   to recover, and set out to rebuild all that had been lost in the previous decades.   \n Some twenty years later, on   in the  , Elminster sought council with the wise warrior   and his dear friend the Srinshee about a spellcaster known as   that was killing many mages in the   of  . Elminster traveled to Aglarond and challenged the Simbul to a spell-duel. The titanic battle that eventually erupted between the two caused much damage to the Witch-Queen's palace before they both agreed to move the battle to  . Their battle continued at the new locale until Elminster realized the Simbul was also one of Mystra's Chosen. \n In the years that followed, Elminster forged a bond of friendship and comradery with the Simbul,  who was in fact  , the sixth daughter of Dornal Silverhand and Mystra.  He called upon both Alassra and the   of   to help defend the recovering Harpers from their Red Wizard enemies in Thay.  Fortunately for El and the Harpers, the Simbul hated the Red Wizards and would gladly keep them and their armies on the defensive. \n As the dark mage Manshoon and his cabal of wizards known as the   emerged as a threat to the Heartlands, Elminster personally took it upon himself to keep them at bay.  He worked with Astorma\u2014then known as  \u2014to recruit adventurers throughout the   and   to once again grow the Harpers' ranks. Eventually Elminster made his home in an   in  ,  near Anastra's old cottage and Storm's farm. \n Elminster did take   time for himself during these years. He managed to make a visit to the   in the  ,  and took extensive notes about all he encountered. \n El unofficially 'retired' to Shadowdale about 15 years later, in the  ,  serving as the   leader of Shadowdale, alongside Lord  .  His retirement however was something of a ruse to provoke certain enemies. \n Despite his efforts to remain hidden, Elminster continued to help new adventuring groups and aid his friends and allies. He played a key part in establishing the Rangers Three.  On   in the  , Elminster agreed to pay off Sir  's tax-debts, despite the displeasure it brought to Vangerdahast the Royal Magician of Cormyr who had been hunting Sabarast.  The  , Elminster helped the young   understand her newly found powers over  ,  and worked to keep her safe from her enemies in the Zhentarim and the Cult of the Dragon. \n During his three attempts at retirement, Elminster started two small wineries and an ice creamery. \n In the  , just before the  , Mystra gained, by some means, foreknowledge about the upcoming calamity (Elminster later theorized this knowledge was offered to her by the overdeity  ). She invested a great deal of her power into the lesser deity   and all of her Chosen, with Elminster himself receiving the greatest amount.  Mystra crafted a magical pendant and bestowed it upon the adventurer  ,  and compelled her with a   to seek out   after the gods had been cast down to the Realms.  At the moment Mystra ceased to be the Goddess of Magic,  magic did not function as normal,  and Elminster lost access to  .  He felt weak and lost, a shadow of the man he was just a day earlier. \n After suffering such a great loss, Elminster's friends and fellow Chosen were greatly worried about him. The adventurer   and two Harpers   and  , known together as the Rangers Three,  watched after El, and together they overthrew a  -controlled outpost in  .  During the conflict, the     sacrificed herself to slay the mortal Manshoon and save Elminster's life. \n Despite their small victory, two great threats to the Heartlands emerged: the extra-planar malaugrym that saw this crisis as an opportunity to exact revenge by slaying Elminster,  and the god  ,  who had taken mortal form in  , and sought to take for himself the  .  In the middle of  , El and his fellow Chosen devised a plan to protect the Old Mage and keep the Realms safe. The ghost of   used   to act as a decoy Elminster, attracting the attention of the malaugrym while the Rangers Three assisted the real Elminster in preserving Mystra and repairing what remained of the fractured Weave. \n On the   as the avatar of Mystra was destroyed by the avatar of Bane,  Elminster reunited with Sylun\u00e9 and the Rangers Three in  , warning them of the growing conflict between the Dales and the   of the North.  Over the following  , El and Mystra's other Chosen, along with the Rangers Three and the Knights of Myth Drannor, held off the malaugrym invasion of the Realms for a time.  They ventured into the Plane of Shadow, killed many of the malevolent shapeshifters in their  ,  and destroyed the malaugrym  , albeit at great cost. \n Having returned to the  , Elminster finally met with the adventurer Midnight on  ,  along with her companions  ,  , and  , at his tower in Shadowdale. He offered them aid in their fight against Bane's forces  \n All the while, Elminster worked old   spells to restore the bodies of the allies that accompanied him to the Castle of Shadows to their natural state. Within a tenday, El was reunited with them in Faer\u00fbn on   of the  . \n El accompanied Midnight and her companions to  , just as the  ,  and helped Midnight perform a   that would located the   before Bane and the Zhentarim.  As the two performed the ritual, Bane's avatar forced his away into the temple. As the   opened up above, Elminster created a rift that conjured Mystra's pure essence in the form of a magic  . The entity imbued Bane's avatar with all of its power, all but destroying his mortal form.  Elminster acted quickly to seal the rift, but was taken within and transported to some other plane. Midnight and her companions believed the Old Mage to be dead. \n While Midnight and her friend Adon were tried for Elminster's \"murder\", they were sprung from imprisonment by their companion Cyric. El's scribe Lhaeo helped them to seek passage to the city of  ,  where Elminster had believed they could find one of the  .  By the time Midnight arrived in the city, El had returned to the Realms, using the alias of Minstrel. He told Midnight she could find the tablet within the local   of  ,  but guided her to another tower so that she could ring the  . As the colossal avatars of Bane and Torm battled outside, and meteors rained down on Tantras from the skies, Elminster helped Midnight ring the bell just in time to shield the city from a catastrophic explosion. \n Elminster remained in touch with Midnight, Adon, and Kelemvor as they traveled west towards Waterdeep in search of the second  ,  and reunited with them at   upon their arrival. El and Khelben offered some insight to the adventurers about how best to proceed in acquiring the tablet from the realm of  , beneath  .  \n Once Midnight and the others succeeded in their mission, Waterdeep was overrun with  's   minions  led by the  . Elminster helped defend the City of Splendors, and helped heroes hide away the   within an extra-dimensional space in Blackstaff Tower, until they could fight off and destroy the avatar of Myrkul himself. El   upon the rest of the dead god's horde, so that Midnight, Kelemvor, and Adon could take the tablets to  . While the allies' former companion Cyric managed to steal both tablets and present them to Ao at the mountain himself,  Midnight was recognized as the hero that had wrested them from the avatars of the gods and was given the opportunity to ascend as the new  . \n In the month of   in the  ,   appeared before Elminster's tower seeking to be trained by the sage of Shadowdale in exchange for the  . Elminster refused the offer but instead asked that Tarth destroy the staff of his former master,   of  . Tarth attempted to trick the Old Mage with a fake staff built by  , but was unsuccessful. After performing the ritual to destroy the staff, the item transform into   who had been trapped in the staff for over 700 years. Elminster explained that Nimra would help train Tarth as she was still bound to Nerndal's service\u2014and now his. \n In the early 1360s DR, the Roadwarden of  ,  , was killed in a treacherous monster ambush. When a group of adventurers involved in defending the   arrived at the site of the battle, Elminster greeted them, his pipe pumping smoke. The old wizard remained unrecognized and offered the group advice in their quest and reiterated the importance of keeping the Keep safe. Elminster pointed out distinctly different monster tracks that led away from the ambush in different directions and hinted at the true perpetrator disappearing into thin air from the science. The mage departed after giving the adventurers a  . \n Elminster assisted Royal Magician Vangerdahast in searching for the missing War Wizard   in   of the  . Together they uncovered a plot by  ,  , and others to wed Alusair Obarskyr and kill  . \n In late   of the  , the   stripped away many of Elminster's memories of her former incarnation's secrets. \n In the same month ,   paid a visit to the famous   of  . The Old Mage offered suggestions on improving the guild's architectural enhancements and ensorcelled amenities and, later, participated in a roundtable meeting with ranking Ravenaar wizards, as well as Chancellor  . The mages discussed the looming extraplanar threat to the Bluff. The same day, Elminster personally sponsored several new members joining the guild \u2013  ,  , and  . All of them were rumored to have elven blood and coming from Elminster's home \u2013 the Dalelands. Elminster took part in many more closed-door meetings that lasted into the morning, joined by some mysterious figures. The Old Mage's visit was accompanied by a host of Harpers that stayed in Ravens Bluff along with Elmisnter. The Sage of Shadowale also found time to give an interview to    , a freelance reporter, with whom he discussed upcoming wizardly meetings but was secretive on the details. \n Later in the year, on  , Elminster was called to   to discuss the   attack on   with Laeral Silverhand, Khelben Arunsun, High Elder  , and High Priestess  .  \n On  , Elminster met with the Lady-of-the-Wood Morgwais in time for the arrival of  ,  ,  , and the    . Elminster confronted Melegaunt on his motives but didn't press the issue too far in the presence of Morgwais.  Later that night during a feast, Elminster followed the group as they tried to leave with the help of  . Melegaunt used his   and the arrival of a phaerimm with its   thralls to drive off Elminster long enough to escape into the  .  \n Elminster fought a running battle against phaerimm, beholders, and even the lich   through the   area of the Dire Wood. Despite this, on  , he eventually stumbled across the   and overheard them planning an attack on Shadowdale while he was trapped in the form of a tree. Exhausted from his long battles and depleted of many spells, Elminster returned to Shadowdale via the   desert and arrived to find the dale's inhabitants and Storm Silverhand embattled already by phaerimm rather than the expected  .  When Elminster approached his tower,   and five other Princes of Shade ambushed Elminster. In the confrontation, spells were thrown, and Storm Silverhand blasted one of the shadow princes with a ball of  . Since Shadovar were living shadow magic and   was pure Weave energy, the collision between the two tore at the fabric of reality and created a rift to the  . Elminster realized that the only way to close the portal before legions of   spilled forth into Toril was to enter within and close it from the other side. \n In the early hours of  , in the  , Elminster entered the portal and narrowly managed to close it, but at the expense of much of his magical strength.  Once in Hell, he was abducted and enslaved by an outcast archdevil known as  ,  who wished to discover the secret of Mystra's  . Elminster was subject to brutal tortures,  surviving only because of his exceptional endurance and ability to heal himself with  . \n While the arch-fiend plundered Elminster's thoughts and memories, Mystra became aware of her favorite servant's plight and entered Hell herself to find him. Realizing that her presence in Hell was overly conspicuous,  Mystra retreated and dispatched more subtle agents to find him, first   the Mad Mage of Undermountain (who was defeated), and then  . After much searching, the Simbul found him, and together they defeated Nergal and returned home. \n In the  , three years after the   began, Elminster later secretly helped a small group of adventurers near   at the village of  . Investigating the fate of a   of Manshoon, they unmasked the clone as the real leader of the   of Westgate, the Night King known as \"The Faceless\". \n On the   in the  , El, Khelben, and Laeral worked powerful   to cleanse the stretch of the   around  , and return to glory the lost city of  . It was then renamed  , the Lost City of Hope. The fantastic feat came at a great loss however, as Khelben Arunsun sacrificed his life to ensure its completion. \n Just over a tenday later, on  ,   agents attempted to steal the   from Elminster's tower. Due to the essence of the artifact and the sheer power of Elminster's wards, on whose power the artifact fed, the Sharrans defeated Elminster (though not without losing most of their number) and a   spell whisked Elminster away, while his tower itself was blasted into ruin and transported to another, unknown plane of existence. \n A decade later, in the  , Mystra was slain in   by the god   working alongside the goddess  .  The magical Weave that permeated   collapsed, and the Spellplague wracked all of Toril.  El and the rest of Mystra's Chosen were stripped of their powers. While El himself could still cast arcane magic, every use of his magic drove him to\u2014and sometimes over\u2014the brink of insanity.  When this happened, only his longtime traveling companion Storm was able to bring his mind back, giving of her own essence to soothe Elminster's mind. \n Elminster's great love and fellow Chosen, Alassra Silverhand, was left in a much worse state following the Spellplague. She absorbed the magical energies released during the cataclysmic event and was afflicted with never-ending madness. On one occasion she unwittingly attacked Elminster at  , and he was forced to defend himself in a devastating spell battle.  The powers she held within were released and absorbed by El, and he became a threat to all the Dales. He absorbed the power from the surrounding landscape, creating pockets of   and conjuring  . The Old Mage was eventually subdued by a band of  ,  and left to languish at the old farm. \n Despite that ordeal, Elminster made it his calling to amass magical or otherwise   items from wherever they were found, and channel their   to Alassra to alleviate her worst symptoms and grant her brief moments of lucidity.  She would remain well for a time, before she flew off to some faraway realm, only to return to one of her favored locales.  El dedicated his life then on to caring for her, while rumors spread that the reverse was true. \n Despite these setbacks, Elminster and Storm continued with their campaign to save Faer\u00fbn, battling evil where they could.  While most people believed they were dead,  the pair watched over Shadowdale,  and even guided aspiring adventurers, like   when drow from   overran the dale.  On one occasion, El heard the voice of Mystra direct him to travel to Zhentil Keep, and destroy the   that Manshoon had corrupted, leading to the death of many noted mages. \n Eventually El and Storm took the aliases of \"Elgorn\" and \"Stornara Rhauligan\", two servants working for the   royal family, and relocated to  . \n After living in such a weakened state for nearly a century, Elminster finally admitted in the  , that he and Storm needed help saving the Realms. Having run out of easy-to-steal magic items to feed to Alassra, Elminster sought to gain access to artifacts known to contain the spirits of  \u2014objects powerful enough to pierce the wards surrounding the   or, Elminster believed, to permanently restore the Simbul's sanity.  In order to achieve these ends, El specifically sought to recruit the efforts of his descendent,  . \n During one of his excursions into the Royal Palace that same year,  Elminster seemed finally slain by Manshoon, who had secretly been peeling away the Old Mage's contingency spells over several years. However, Manshoon departed before he realized that Elminster had survived his body's destruction in a near-  state.  \n With Amarune's consent and the aid of Storm, Elminster's essence was placed in the body of his great-grandaughter by means of a spell the ex-Chosen had discovered in a cache once belonging to Azuth. He then sought to train his great-granddaughter while attempting to defend the Forest Kingdom from Manshoon and traitorous nobles alike.  He shared Rune's body with her for a time, but soon discovered how to   cohabit the body of her paramore, Lord  , along with his consciousness. \n As El learned to navigate his new bodiless existence, Storm discovered a means of permanently curing Alassra of her madness: by helping her consume one of the powerful   items seemingly created during the Spellplague.  Meanwhile, the Manshoon of   was enacting a convoluted scheme to manipulate the   and install himself as Emperor of Cormyr. \n The situation came to a head as El, Storm, and the others struggled to offer the   item to Alassra within a secluded cave, and Manshoon appeared before them all. Alassra returned to her full self, restored Elminster's physical form, and presented everyone with a missive from her long-dead mother: El and Manshoon would have to work together against the machinations of   and close the many inter-planar rifts that had been opened by   and others during the last hundred years. If they failed, the   would take over Toril, and the world of elves, men, and dwarves would be no more. Elminster and Manshoon both agreed to work alongside the other... for a time. \n Manshoon's loyalty to the others lasted all but a few minutes. Just after Alassra left to begin their work,  Manshoon used his magic to once again cast Elminster from his body and plunge his essence into the  .  El's ephemeral form lingered in the Underdark for a time, witnessing a wider scope of the effects of the Spellplague,  before encountering the consciousness of  , an elf that had lived in Cormanthor when El first stepped into the city.  They traveled together as El came to inhabit the body of a   woman  and eventually made his way back up to the surface world. \n El had managed to make his way back to Cormyr, reunited with Amarune,  and heralded Mystra's return to the Realms. He entered into the mind of an honest and stalwart member of the   and informed them their aid would be needed during the conflict ahead. \n Meanwhile, Alassra worked tirelessly  to close rifts that had been opened across the Realms.  She eventually made her way to an isolated keep shrouded in blueflame and overrun with  .  She wielded her   to slay many demons, but was nearly overwhelmed and called out to Elminster and Mystra for help. While Alassra emerged victorious,  El heard her pleas but could not be heard in response.  As she continued with her quest, consuming blueflame items became increasingly taxing on her body. \n When Elminster witnessed so much needless death and destruction caused by Manshoon's schemes that he went into a murderous rage and unleashed all the remaining magic he had upon his old foe. It was not enough however, and El's newest body was blasted apart by the city's War Wizards. Alassra arrived moments later and sacrificed herself to restore El's rightful body and make himself whole again. Absolutely distraught with the loss of his lifelong love, Elminster went on to systematically slay everyone responsible for the events leading up to that point. He saved Manshoon for last, melting his body with  ,  despite knowing the centuries-old despot could not be truly destroyed save for by divine intervention. \n El resisted the urge to allow his rage to overtake him. He returned to the cave where Alassra was cured, carrying with him the power of the blueflame items she had amassed. El returned the arcane power to Mystra, allowing her to fully return as the Goddess of Magic once again. \n After suffering such tremendous loss, Elminster went to   for its Protector's Jubilee to see the city's renewal for himself. A guest of honor at the  , Elminster bade adventurers who sought him out to escort merchants through the hostile territory of  ,  , and  ; had them meet with and bring a coded message left by an   with the Blacklake gangs; had them capture a coded message from the   for the Harpers to decrypt; and directed them to covertly transcribe certain notes from   at  , among others. \n When the restored Cult of the Dragon emerged as a threat to the Sword Coast in the 1480s DR,  Elminster joined the armies of the   at the  , and helped prevent   from summoning   to the Realms. \n Over the next few years, Elminster and Storm Silverhand, along with Amarune and Arclath, traveled across the Realms working to strengthen the Weave at locales where some magical   managed to survive the Spellplague. After adventuring in a dungeon near   in the   in the  ,  they learned that the Shadovar of Thultanthar had begun investigating similar points of interest across Faer\u00fbn. To stop Shar's agents from carrying out their goddess's plot to takeover the Weave as part of the  , El ventured to Candlekeep to learn more about the situation. Storm, Amarune, and Arclath meanwhile traveled to the reborn city of Myth Drannor. \n While in Candlekeep, El discovered that both Shadovar agents and two of his fellow Chosen\u2014Alustriel and Laeral\u2014had spent years, decades even, within the library-fortress, preparing for events that were about to unfold. El's old friend Khelben had previously gleaned insight into the series of world-changing events known as the   and had developed a contingency plan. Khelben's fellow Moonstars, along with Alustriel and Laeral, intended to destroy the wards of Candlekeep in order to prevent Shar and the Shadovar from utilizing them.  While El remained aghast at the idea, the lich   appeared before the trio and offered an alternative. Unlike Mystra's living Chosen, Larloch had expertly retained his power following the Spellplague,  and was in fact responsible for the unfortunate events surrounding the   items some years prior.  Larloch taught El how to use his power as a weave anchor to channel the power of Candlekeep's wards and preserve them, while simultaneously turning away the Shadovar. As Elminster saw Shar as a greater threat to the Realms than the lich, he accepted the Shadow Lord's offer, and began carrying out their plan. \n As agents of the Moonstars broke into Candlekeep to excise the Shadovar within, Elminster linked minds with the leaders of the   to gain access to the library's wards. Unfortunately, Larloch betrayed El and the others and used the mind-link to slay many of Candlekeep's monks. The Shadow King was then able to strip away Canlekeep's powerful wards for his own use.  Elminster learned his lesson. He and his fellow Chosen quickly made their way to Myth Drannor, to ensure  Larloch could not also steal the power from the city's restored  . \n They arrived too late, however, as Larloch invaded the minds of Thultanthar's citizens and began the ritual to consume the  . El meanwhile used the technique Larloch taught him\u2015bolstered by the support of Laeral and Alustriel\u2015and gained control of the flying city itself. Given extra power by the Srinshee after she sacrificed what remained of her unlife, Elminster brought Thultanthar crashing down atop Myth Drannor in a cataclysmic blast that destroyed both cities. Fortunately, most residents of Myth Drannor had been evacuated before. The goddess Shar declined to further escalate her plot and admitted failure to her rival Mystra. \n The  , El hosted an event at   in Cormyr, home of the noble-born merchant  .  Several powerful   were summoned to the old manor, which was then caught in the middle of a powerful  , on the promise they could possibly attain powerful magic: the  . Mystra wished that the mages would come together in the spirit of camaraderie to help guide the Realms following the dual tragedies of the Spellplague and Second Sundering. \n Unfortunately, the gathering led to a series of grisly murders, as several of the mages slew each other in order to take the   for themselves.  In the end, Elminster destroyed the scroll of the   and eradicated the spellstorm surrounding the manor.  At Mystra's request,  he finally enacted justice on Manshoon for his atrocities. El removed the spindle of  's divine essence from within the   of the ancient wizard, but left him alive to languish without his power.  \n Later on, in the  , Elminster and former Lord of Waterdeep  \u2015who had been restored to life after his consciousness remained within a   weapon for over a century\u2015returned to the city of Waterdeep. Together they aided the city's recently appointed   Laeral Silverhand identify the culprits responsible for murdering numerous  . \n The  , Elminster involved himself in the emergent   that threatened all of Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast. He sought after  , a fellow wizard and lover of Mystra, who bore a   within his chest. \n At some point, Mystra sent Elminster to the world of   to investigate   terrorizing its lands; Elminster suspected the Adenthian form of magical called chaos power was infecting her own magic. After destroying a few and learning they were connected to the local Penultima cult, he enlisted the aid of a local adventurer, the   mechanic  , and her companions.  At a local tavern, they ran into a Penultima cultist who boasted of the dracoliches' power and directed them to their next attack.  There, they discovered weakened, imitation dracoliches raised using chaos power from ancient dragon bones, but prone to madness, rage, and spontaneous disintegration.  Fortunately, Gerana resonated with the chaos power in the bones and led Elminster to a wizard's tower guarded by a Penultima cultist. Inside, they found a copy of the  , a long way from Toril, before cultists summoned them to meet their new leader: none other than Elminster's old foe Sammaster.  In the cult fortress, Sammaster revealed that he'd resurrected himself on Adenthia, where he was venerated by Penultima as Adenthia's long-lost Child of Chaos and sought to take over that world with dracoliches as he had attempted on Toril. In the end, they fought and Elminster and Gerana destroyed Sammaster again in a lengthy battle, saving the world and bringing peace,  .  Afterward, Elminster declined the offer of a massage and they returned to the tavern to celebrate, where Elminster named a local   \"Elminster's Choice\" before he departed, presumably returning to his own world. \n According to the  , Elminster owed his longevity in part to a hidden cache of   bread imported from  .

Heat up the Dutch oven on medium-low heat and melt the butter inside. Add chopped vegetables and cook, stirring, until translucent and fragrant. Add mushrooms and tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes more until they darken in color.\n In a separate frying pan, add neutral oil, enough to coat the pan but not enough to puddle in it. Heat it on medium-high. Dab the beef dry with paper towels and sear the meat on all sides. We need a dark caramelized color, but we do not need to cook it. Once browned, transfer into the Dutch oven. Wipe the oil off the frying pan and deglaze with wine. Scrape all the fond and pour it into the Dutch oven. Add stock, enough to cover the meat almost all the way. Season with salt and pepper (you can taste and adjust later), and add herbs and spices. Bring to a boil and transfer to a preheated oven at 350F, covered. Cook for about 45-50 minutes; check the Dutch oven about 30 minutes in to make sure it's not lost all of its liquid. At 45 minutes, uncover and check if the meat is tender and is falling off the bone. If there is still too much liquid, cook for 10 more minutes uncovered.\n Once ready, there is no need to strain. Scoop the entire dish out into a bowl. Make sure to discard if anyhting is burnt. Once cool, pull out the bones and shred the meat into small pieces. Cover tightly to stop it from drying off and chill overnight or set aside to add to the gruel later. There should be enough thick and flavorful liquid to keep the meat from drying.\n Akabar's gruel (2 servings):\n Presentation (optional):\nHoney hardtack, green chili peppers, chopped herbs.\n Now let us start on the goo, I mean gruel. Add wine to a saucepan and cook it for 8 minutes on high to evaporate alcohol. Add barley and stock with spices, and cook for 8 more minutes on medium-high. Now add in all the minced braised meat and caramelized vegetables. Stir in, cover, and cook for 4-5 more minutes on low. At this point, the gruel will be viscous; keep it on low heat and stir egg yolks, lemon zest, and cream in. Remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasoning.\n Akabar's gruel is much spicier than this, but to remedy it, you can add a tablespoon of smoked hot red pepper when you're starting the gruel. Ladle the gruel into bowls. Top with fresh green chilies, herbs, and honey  . I personally like topping it with poached egg with a runny yolk and sprinkled with herbs. Another alternative is to make   from a previous meal and pour it on top.\n At the end of the day, good stewed meat and a handful of spices can make anything delicious, especially after a long track through the wilderness. This recipe works so much better with barley due to a bit of a chew that particular grain has. You can also adjust the dish's thickness with a bit more stock and cream. Other than that \u2013 we are ready to eat!\n Next   \u2013 we are going to make some yummy   appetizers or handfoods they make for   every year in huge quantities!\n And until then,  , friends,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Forgive my forgetfulness, but have we talked about   in the always beautiful  ? The majestic city of canals and glistening domes and villas wrapped in fragrant greenery and colorful flowering vines. Despite the city's love for lavish splendor, we are going to talk about a simple morningfeast dish you can find on the tables of nobles and commoners alike. Arrabarran stuffed fish is a simple steaming of saltwater   stuffed with morningfeast staples and served with cheesy eggs drenched in a two-ingredient sauce.\n Stuffed bream (serves 2):\n This dish will require you to cook the fish in a parchment envelope, so make sure you get a creature of an appropriate size for your oven. Arrabarran fish comes in several parts. You will need  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and white wine for the fish (I used seawater  . A huge beast with little flesh - perfect for one). For scrambled  , you will need  , eggs, soft, easy-to-melt  , and more white wine and lemon juice for the sauce.   from   is a good pick for this particular dish.\n We will need to act quickly because bream cooks quickly, and you want to serve everything as it is hot.\nThe first thing you need to do is chop potatoes into smaller cubes and cook them on a skillet in butter until soft. Fry up crumbled sausage. Mix both fried items with black and white  ,  ,  , and dried fennel. Feel free to add chopped aromatic herbs. Set the frying pan aside; we will deglaze all the good sausage bits from it in a few minutes.\nFirst, de-scale your fish with the back of your knife, moving against the grain, and remove its sharp fins and ridges with a pair of sharp scissors. Dab the fish's skin and the belly cavity dry, and remove any blood and slime. Prepare an envelope of parchment. The best way to use a single big square sheet. Fold it on all sides to make a bowl of sorts. Place the fist in the center. Generously apply salt and pepper to its skin on both sides. Open the cavity and spoon in your potato, sausage, and seasoning mixture. Slightly press down and in to keep everything in place. You might want to use toothpicks to keep the stuffing in by puncturing the cavity's opening. Place several slices of lemon, fennel, and a sprig of rosemary on top of the fish. Now squeeze a bit of lemon juice into the envelope and add a drizzle of white wine. See, this is why the paper needed to be folded to resemble a bowl. Now, carefully bring the sides together and fold them against each other to seal. You can use egg white as a sort of glue to keep it together or find another way to keep it in place. Now fold the other side, and roll it seal-up. We want to make it as sealed as possible to keep the steam in.\n Place on a sheet pan and cook for 20 minutes at 325F (but the time will differ depending on the fish's size).\n Eggs and lemon sauce:\n Now, let's make eggs. Whisk the eggs together with desired seasonings and a dash of water or cream. Preheat a pan with butter to medium-low, pour your eggs in, and add shredded soft cheese. Now, do not waste a moment and start moving the egg mix around the pan as you jerk the pan back and forth. Soon, you will start noticing its scrambling. Do not stop moving the eggs to ensure they are gooey and creamy. When they are slightly under the consistency you desire (baby spit is the term I've heard before. Gross), remove them from the fire and transfer them carefully into a container to keep eggs covered and warm.\n The last part is now; we are almost done. The lemon and white sauce is easy and might not appeal to everyone due to its acidity. Remove all the fat from the pan. Return the sausage fry pan to the fire and add a glass of white wine to the pan. Deglaze and scrape all the cooked-on pieces of sausage. Add the juice of half a lemon, salt, and pepper to taste. Zest lemon and set it aside to be added very last. Pump up the heat and reduce. When 80% of the liquid is gone, turn the heat down, throw in a cube of fresh butter, and stir it in. Thoroughly mix, and add another one. Check your sauce's consistency by coating the back of the spoon or moving the spatula across the pan's bottom. If it leaves behind a clean stripe - it is ready. Transfer the sauce into a sauce boat.\n Carefully open the paper envelope and transfer the fish onto the platter. Place the scrambled eggs by the bream's belly. Re-decorate the fish with fresh herbs and fennel. Add hand-ripped bread to the platter and pour the sauce onto the eggs.\n The morningfeast is served. Arrabarran stuffed fish is exactly what you would expect from the dish\u2014a wine-steamed soft and flaky beast with potatoes and eggs and fresh (or not so fresh)   to dip into the sauce and eggs. I experienced this dish when visiting the   family of Arrabar. The old matriarch of the clan,  , insisted I share the meal, fragrant blossom tea, and delicate wafers with honey and whipped cream as we gossiped about the recent scandals of some northern cities of splendor that shall remain unnamed.\n For the future, I might want to try different fish and sweeter wine with herbs, and instead of hand-ripped bread, I want to pan-fry cubes of white loaves in butter and sage. What do you think, dear reader? What improvements or regional variants can you think of? I can't wait to hear from you!\n Now it is time for the eveningfeast here, and it has been a long day for this hin.\n  my bezzies, and until the next meal we share.\n Yours as always,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n As the grand month of   continues, we have more dishes to try from the city of  . Do not mind recent rumors of flying magic ships, cultists, and tentacled squid-faced men! Speaking of monsters. How often have you had the courage and curiosity to imbibe monster meat? Today, I will share another simple recipe with you that, I believe, originated from the  . By some accords, it is one of the oldest dishes in the recorded history of   and eaten anywhere this particular nasty beastie is found.\n The dish is  . Now let me explain. Despite these creatures being notorious pests that feed on blood, they are quite edible and flavorful. Three  , butchered and portioned, is usually enough to make two servings of this sandwich or a single meal-sized sandwich. However, do not rush into eating a stirge! For safety reasons, the only edible parts of the beast are muscle knots at the wing base. A talented butcher can quickly remove these morsels for you and preserve feathers of stirge fat that only adds flavor to these cuts.\n But of course, stirges are not widely available. There are substitutes and several recipes that imitate the entire dish, and several, in fact, are easily replaceable by anyone.   ribs are a good substitute if seasoned well. Another one is pork chops, as long as they are not overcooked. The best substitute, however, flavor-wise, is  . Its rich flavor is close to stirge meat due to its sanguineous diet. Additionally, if you are using pork, you must invest time into sauces and marinates to replicate the sweet, acidic, and slightly smoky taste \u2013 this is exactly what we are doing today.\n As I mentioned above, this particular dish version is from the   of Baldur's Gate. It is from poorer areas, so it lacks any sophistication, but it is delicious and filling still.   is known for its oddball   theme as porcine dishes, and this version of the ancient sandwich uses thinly-sliced pork chops and is a morningfeast, served with strong, almost mud-like   and  . With all of the above in mind, let us begin. This will be a two-serving recipe.\n Sauce and marinade:\n (1 tankard of fruity ale to add to the sauce to marinade pork as well as a t. of red pepper paste, bay leaf, and two crushed garlic cloves)\n First, we will make the sauce. Add a teaspoon of neutral vegetable oil or sesame oil and heat it up. Add garlic mash and cook whilst constantly stirring for one or two minutes. Do not let it burn. Now add the rest of the ingredients into the saucepan and mix well. Cook on high heat until the sauce starts to boil. Continue cooking while stirring for up to five more minutes, and reduce the heat to simmer. Now, let it slowly cook and thicken for twenty minutes or so. When the sauce is ready, you will be able to have it coat the back of the spoon and stay in place after you do the finger-wipe test.\n Once ready, let it cool. To make the marinade enough for six thinly-portioned pork chops, add one tankard of the sauce and one tankard of ale with crushed garlic cloves, a bay leaf, and red pepper flakes or paste.\n Toast:\n First thing first, make the marinade and season all the thin pork chops with salt and sugar. Submerge them in the marinade and let it be for at couple of hours at least, or overnight. If you want your chops even thinner \u2013 using a meat tenderizer mallet is an option, but be warned, it will make the cooking time much shorter. When the marinating is done, remove the chops and pat them dry, season with salt and pepper again and set aside in an icebox. Pour all of your marinade into a saucepan and boil it down to one third of it amount. We need it to thicken again but to a glaze level. It will take some time so its a good thing to do ahead, before you start cooking you meat. Taste the glaze and adjust its acidity, sweetness, and saltiness. Keep warm and set aside.\n Prepare the bread next. Beat together the  , add salt and pepper. Now gently brush the egg into both of the    , sliced in the middle length-wise. Three eggs is just enough for all four slices. Heat up a skillet with butter and fry bread on all sides. Set aside and keep warm.\n We are making two types of stirge on toast. One will the panfried and baked in wine or, more precisely, poached. Te other will be seared and tossed in glaze. Melt lard on a skillet and heat it up. Do a quick sear for all the chops on all sides. We want some color but don't want to overcook. A minute on high flames per side would be enough. Set aside three seared chops and leave three on the pan. Add  , squeeze half a   into the wine, toss the remnants of the fruit in, add a sprig of   and place in a pre-heated oven. We want the oven to be at 425F. (for thick pork chops, their final inner temperature should be at 145F). Bake them, basting every other minute for about 10 minutes. Do not go over 15 minutes!\n While this meat is being baked, chop the rest of the chops into bite-sized pieces and toss them together with the thickened glaze on medium high heat, regularly tossing them to coat evenly in thick dark sweet glaze. It should take just enough time to finish as it is for the rest to bake.\n Now finishing touches. Split freshly shredded   in two. Chop up  , mix them and split in two. Mix half of herbs and half of cheese together and set aside. Take half a cup of thick    , heat it up and stir in the cheese. Make sure it's well melted and incorporated. Taste, make sure it's not overly salty. You will need to mix the rest of the herbs in right before serving.\n Assembly time. Open up the   and line the bottoms with a handful of fresh arugula.   is another good choice, especially if you live in a swampy area and have it available locally. Layer baked stirge or chops on one and glazed chops on the other. Top the baked morningfeast sandwich with cheese and chicken gravy and close the sandwich. For the glazed stirge \u2013 make sure there is enough glaze in the sandwich. Add shredded herbed cheese on top of the glaze and quickly blast it with flames to let it. Use a   \u2013 literal or a kitchen type, using a   or a kitchen torch is a second best option. Close the sandwich and serve.\n I know, I know, this morningfeast is not as titillating as eating a bloodsucking beast, but the flavor is next to the real thing. I could eat stirge on toast every morning if i could. I do hope you enjoyed this dish and we will meet again in just a single   to continue a tour of Baldurian cuisine.\n , my friends, and until we have more monster meats to try, stay safe and happy.\n Yours as always,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n After a small hiatus, we are back with this  's recipe. A throwback to our visit to the   in  , this is part two of what they have on offer. A hardy meal simply called Fried Hack \u2013 a plateful of fried chopped vegetables in a pancake form,  , and pan-fried  , all served together and drizzled with  , as customary throughout the  . If you are visiting the Arnise Hold on a busy day, the best you can hope for is chopped vegetables fried in bacon fat until crispy and piled on a plate, but if the kitchen is relatively free, you are in for a treat. The vegetables and thinly julienned and smothered in savory pancake batter, seasonings, and spices, and fried in neat pucks using bacon drippings or   or   fat. The vegetable selection is seasonal, but usually, you can expect  ,  ,  , and  . As for the  , it is never smoked to order; of course, the castle's food storage has a sizable stock of preserved seafood.   or   is the best option, in my opinion. Salmon ends up having a nice flaky texture and flavor, while trout comes with skin that gets crispy and delicious when fried up. Lastly, the gravy is brown and mildly spiced. I, on the other hand, prefer having white sausage gravy with this morningfeast. In this recipe, I will also help you smoke fish (or anything else you could bake) at home, even though it is nowhere as delicious as foods smoked in the smokehouses of Amn. \n This morningfeast dish is notably not typical for Amn and, as I can only presume, traveled down the trade routes from  . Similar fried vegetables are quite popular in  ,  , and in the cities on the northern side of the  , but the fried hack found there is rarely presented as a crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside vegetable pancake. I have also heard of bigger variants of these pancakes with other types of vegetables, sweet  , and hot green and red peppers, made in  , possibly influenced by foods brought over via the   that connected   and the empire of  .\n Fried Hack\n Makes two large servings or four small servings:\n We shall begin by crisping some bacon. I prefer flat slices, so in order to avoid curling, we need to press them or oven-bake on low heat. I baked mine at 200F for about 30-40 minutes. The result was flat and crispy. We need the drippings, so pour them into a bowl and use them to fry up the hack and the fish later in the recipe.\n Wash and peel the vegetables and slice them into thin ribbons. We want them to be very fine so the vegetables cook quickly. This cut is called a julienne. As for pepper and onion, simply slice them as thin as you possibly can. You can also add chopped chives, green onions, or parsley here if you so please.\n Sprinkle salt into the sliced vegetables and mix to evenly spread. You will need at least a teaspoon of finely ground salt. Cover and let the vegetables soak the salt in for five minutes. Soon, you will notice the vegetables are releasing liquid. Pour it out.\n Add an egg, water, two spoonfuls of  , and spices. Use your hands to mix everything to incorporate all the ingredients and coat the vegetables in the batter. If the batter looks very runny, sprinkle a bit more flour in. We jsut need the batter to hold the vegetables together. Now is a good time to fry up a bit of the mix and taste to make sure the seasoning is to your liking. For additional savory flavor, you can dissolve a spoonful of miso in water before adding it to the vegetables.\n Now we get to frying. I used a puck-shaped pan, but you can easily just use a large saut\u00e9ing pan. Brush the pan with bacon drippings and preheat it on medium heat \u2013 it will help the pancakes not to stick. Scoop the vegetable mix into the frying pan and shape it into small and round pucks. I like to let them brown quickly on the bottom and then reduce the temperature to medium-low and cook until the batter on the top starts thickening. Now flip them over if the bottom looks crispy and cook until done.\n To fry smoked fish, simply preheat the bacon drippings to medium-high and sear the first skin down until the skin is crispy - about three minutes, then flip and sear the other side. If you are using pre-made smoked fish, remember that it will be salty and flaky, but if you cook your own, it will be tougher and infused with a smoky flavor rather than truly cooked by hot smoke. But below is the recipe for how to cook in an improvised home smoker. \n Home-smoked fish\n Makes two servings:\n Layer the bottom of the Dutch oven with at least three large pieces of tin foil and leave enough hanging on the sides \u2013 we will bring the sides together to seal. Place a spoonful of fine, thin wood chips on the bottom in a thin layer. Cover it with a small piece of tinfoil to protect it from dripping. Clump tinfoil to make balls on which you will place the fish and sing down. It will allow the fish to cook from all sides. Dry the filets before smoking.\n Sprinkle it with salt, pepper, and whatever glaze you might like to have on your fish, but use a tiny amount so as not to overpower the gravy later. Place the entire Dutch oven on the burning flames on medium-high. We need the bottom to heat up and start burning the wood. When you start noticing a light smoke, bring the floppy sides of the tinfoil together and seal the fish with the chips in a tight clump. Cover with the Dutch oven top and cook for 25 minutes or so. Do not smoke it at home if the oven you are using is not completely or almost air-tight. There will be a lot of smoke inside.\n When done, simply remove them from the flame and let them cool before frying the filets in bacon.\n A good plating is two fried vegetable pucks, two pieces of smoked and dried fish, and three bacon strips. Add some gravy, any kind you prefer, and serve while still hot.\n And this concludes, or almost concludes, meals from the Arnise Hold in western Amn. Morningfeast of Hack, followed by boar  , generous amounts of juices and decent local  , as well as cream-covered fruits.\n Next time, we will be making   from  , and a recipe will be a dish from  .\n Untill then,  \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n If you've ever traveled by the  , you've likely passed the small, unassuming shepherd village named  . Despite its size, you can always find lodgings and simple food there. We will make one of the typical morning feasts in Fendarl's Gate, and, as I promised the last  , we will use up any roasted   leftovers you might've saved.\n Hardbread:\n We will begin by making hard-crust bread we will serve the morningfeast on. You will need half a tankard of warm water, one small spoonful of dried  , a pinch of  , three tankards of  , one tankard of cold water, a pinch of  , a pinch of large-crystal salt, and a pinch of powdered red pepper. Bloom the yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar. When foam appears, add in the rest of the water, and one tankard of flour, mix well, sprinkle with salt and pepper, add the rest of the flour, and knead until smooth. Brush two pie molds with oil and put the dough in, gently pressing it into a rough flat shape, spreading evenly or as even as you can make it. Brush the top with oil, cover it, and let it grow double in size. It should take about an hour in a warm kitchen or an hour and a half in a chilly room. Remove the covering, and with a  , prick the dough in a circle at the edge. Your bread will deflate. Now sprinkle it with coarse crystals, of course. Let it rest as you pre-heat the oven to 450F. Place a sheet pan of water at the very bottom of the oven and your pie tins in the middle. Bake for 30-40 minutes until the top is hard, crusty, and browned.\n The second part of this morningfeast is kitchenscrap gravy. You know how to make gravy, so I will skip it this time. I made   and   and    , using all the scraps I had from the night before. Keep it bubbling on low heat until you're ready to serve it.\n In another pan, melt a spoonful of butter and add double that amount of frying oil. Slice your leftover   or   roasts into a bread-slice thickness and toss them to brown in the oil and butter mix on medium heat. Keep an eye on it so the pork doesnt burn. We want it browned and crusty. In the end, throw into the butter some leftover herbs, like  ,  , and  , and spoon the now-fragrant oil over the sliced roast.\n Boar and eggs:\n Browning pork will have to be done simultaneously as you are making your fluffy  . Take four eggs, beat them together with one-fourth tankard of  , sprinkle with salt and pepper, add a pinch of powdered red pepper, and a generous handful of very thinly sliced spring   and   (you might have pan-cooked leeks from the night before if you do, use them). Mix well and pre-heat a large frying pan with oil. We want the oil to be hot so the eggs will start cooking immediately and puff up. Whip the mix again and courageously pour it into the hot pan. Cover the pan so the top is being cooked too. Check the color of the eggs three minutes in, reduce the heat, and keep cooking covered. When the eggs are light brown to golden on the bottom and the top is just slightly wet, carefully fold the eggs in half. Cut with your spatula in two and serve immediately.\n Put the bread-plate at the bottom, layer fanning the browned   slices, and on the other side of the bread, place the green eggs. You should have enough for two servings. Serve the gravy in a bowl on the side. You can break off a piece of bread, top it with egg and a slice of pork to finish the morningfeast finger-sandwiches, dip it in the scrap gravy and enjoy.\nAs I promised, we got another simple morningfeast dish and used up a bunch of things in the kitchen instead of throwing it all to the  .\n Next  , I will tell you about my semi-successful attempt at making a  . I promise you, there are no rats and cats involved despite what some might tell you on the streets of  !\n This is all I have for you this time, my dear friends.\n  and until the next time we meet.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good tidings, dear reader.\n Today I present you with a delectable and nourishing fare from the  . As I traveled past the village of   several seasons past, a dumpy caravan hand, who's passed the village many-a-times, told me about a local curiosity \u2013 the oh-so-creatively called \" .\" I had to investigate. Locals recommended a beautifully named eatery called  , noting that a halfling of my stature would find her belly happily filed with the Maid's generously piled-up dishes. I will talk about some of the foods of note I found at the restaurant (and no, regrettably, no \"Shield moss\" was served to me that day).\n One of Maid's staples, recommended by the eatery's delightful staff, was something called a \"Fryplate.\" A morningfeast of vegetables and  . Below, I am reporting an attempt to recreate the dish in my humble burrow.\n Take a handful of plump   and slice them lengthwise. For the best result, find the most oblong fruits. I recommend sweet tomatoes from  . Take your favorite skillet and generously lard it up. However, drizzling it with flavorful   from the   brings out grassy notes and adds complexity to the dish. Place your sliced tomatoes, cut-side up, onto the skillet. Sprinkle them with  , minced  , and   like  ,  , and  . You can purchase most of them from   if you are in a pinch or need to feed an entire household. Drizzle more oil over the seasoned tomatoes, turn up the heat and cook covered for about 10 minutes.\n Meanwhile, throw another skillet on the flame and fill it with   (I personally prefer cubed  ) and a handful of wild  . Fry it all together on high flames with a sprinkle of salt and  , until mushrooms are delicately golden-hued like   's \" \" at dawn.\n Not what it's been 10 minutes, uncover the tomatoes and inhale the mouthwatering aroma. Take a utensil, a   fork would do, and press down on tomatoes to flatten them and release the juices. Keep the skillet uncovered and cook until the liquid is almost completely gone and tomato skin starts getting caramelized.\n Now that you have 2 of 3 parts of the so-called Fryplate, you can start working on the star of the show. Take a handful of black   and crush them with a pot or a skillet. Asking a   friend to help would be a bad idea, believe me. Toss the crushed peppercorns into a sauce pot, toast it on high flame for a minute or two and add a 1/4th of a   filled with your favorite  . You can make your own or find an inn with an open kitchen window early in the day and scoop some stock while the cooks are distracted. Add a drizzle of  . My personal favorite is   brandy, but you can follow your muse. Cook the ingredients together until reduced, then add fresh  , just a bit to flavor, and thicken it sauce. Taste, season, reduce, and keep warm. (If you are looking to impress easily amused simpleton humans, add brandy first, then tilt the skillet to light it aflame. Us hin are not prone to such faff.)\n Prepare yet another skillet; yes, you need many skillets! I do not envy Maid of the Moors' dishwashers! Crack three or four eggs into a bowl, season, mix well with a spoonful of cream, then deposit it onto a buttered-up skillet. On low, start moving the egg mix. You will see cooking soon, so pay attention! As the eggs start to thicken, add the peppercorn and brandy sauce, making sure not to add too much. We need eggs to be gooey, not soupy! Continue cooking the eggs while moving it around with a spatula as you jerk the skillet on the fire back and forth. When the eggs are coagulated and cooked but are still soft and creamy, take off the heat and get ready to assemble the whole Fryplate.\n Now your tomatoes will be ready. Carefully scoop them out and place them carefully on a serving dish. For a more rustic experience, serve it all right in the skillet! Atop the tomatoes, pile up your cooked bacon and mushrooms. Generously sprinkle them with thinly sliced  . Carefully transfer the eggs from one skillet to the serving dish atop the fragrant assembly. Now all you need is to make it pretty and sprinkle it with some sliced almonds, drizzle peppercorn sauce if you have any left, and strategically place fresh herbs and/or chives on the mound.\n And here you go\u2014the Fryplate from Maid of the Moors of Mornbryn's Shield. Granted, my version took some liberty with the presentation, as the good folk of the Maid piled the fried goodies on a plate for you, but to people from the City of Splendors, or the Forest Kingdom, my plating, I am sure, would appeal better.\n Remember to serve some hot   with your dish. I hope you enjoy this exotic recipe from the fairway banks of the  .\n \"Amarast\" for now, my friends.\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n The hamlet of   might only be known by the name on the shingles along the   or as a place where rushing couriers stop to change their steeds just before reaching the walled town of  . Even Master Traveler of all the Realms   only gave it a cursory look in his guides. And that might be understandable as, even if it is quite picturesque, nestled by a cliff, it offers little for a bold adventurer or an epicure traveler. When visiting, you might visit the local graveyard and listen to a scary story beside a terrifying statue of a local mythical beast,  , or buy a pie or a caramel-dipped   from the lovely  , or, if you are lucky, you might catch some outlandish performance at the  . And that is about all the hamlet can offer.\n However, it is also home to one magnificent creature:  . This   is a luminary in the noble art of garlic-craft. He is the creator of the  , a magically enhanced plant that can offer you fresh   without the need to dig around your backyard like a  . This  's recipe comes from Rab's masterwork cookbook, aptly titled  . You might know it from its reprinting titled   or a later re-edited and somewhat less popular release named   The recipe in question is  , a pie that takes a whopping ten heads of garlic, freshly harvested from the vine, and filo pastry dough you can purchase from Nell's Pie Shop, but be sure to place the order at least a tenday ahead. Despite the cookbook being sold across the  , according to Rab, his dishes are rarely seen gracing the tables of the good folk. So, my dear reader, consider this your chance to surprise your guests or loved ones with a freshly baked garlic pie. Shall we begin?\n Garlic Guy Pie\n Makes one pie:\n First, we will need to peel and trim the roots from an ungodly number of garlic cloves, just enough to fill two cups. Preheat the oven to 325F and toss the garlic cloves into an oven-safe deep baking dish or a saucepan. Add two sprigs of  , a thick slice of  , and two  , and add   enough to cover the garlic. Leave the pot uncovered and roast it in the oven for 45 minutes or until the cloves turn soft and creamy. Alternative cooking time and temperature is 250F and one and a half or two hours of roasting time for a lighter and creamier result. I personally separated 1/5 cups and roasted them, tossed them in a bit of oil, and wrapped them in tinfoil alongside to get some of the cloves to develop a bit of Maillard reaction. I prefer using non-virgin olive oil, but other oils would be fine. You could also use virgin olive oil, as the baking will remove all grassy notes and bitterness once the cooking is done. When the cloves are ready to be taken out, strain them out and set aside. Do not dispose of the oil, as we just made a delicious and fragrant infused oil. You will need to use a spoonful of it for the pie in a few moments and for most anything in the kitchen on a later day.\n Now to the pie itself. Firstly, assemble and measure out all of the ingredients as Philo dough is very fragile and needs to be worked quickly. Melt the butter and keep it warm and liquid. In a bowl big enough for mixing, combine  ,  , and a cup and a half of cooked garlic from the previous step. Add a spoonful of garlic oil from the garlic cooking step, as well as a spoonful of balsamic  . Mix all of the ingredients until the eggs are fully broken down and the mixture is smooth. Add the spices and seasonings and mix one again. Set aside for the time being. Preheat the oven to 375F.\n Prepare a pie tin. I used a shallow one for aesthetic purposes. Dip the baker's brush in melted butter and lightly coat the tin in it. Unseal the pre-made roll of phyllo dough. It is important to keep the sheets separated by plastic and keep the top layer covered with a damp paper towel to keep the sheets from drying off and breaking. One sheet at a time, place it on a clean curring board or a baking sheet and brush it with melted butter. Transfer the buttered sheet to the pie tin and GENTLY press it into all the crevices and bends, letting the sides dangle. Once again, gently wrinkle the extra dangling bits to form the crust ends, like wrinkled and crumbled paper. Repeat it with ten sheets of phyllo dough, slightly rotating each consecutive layer to form an even pie shell. You will have leftover sheets. Wrap them back and place them in a sealed container or a bag, wrapped in a moist paper towel to use for something later. And I surely will have more uses for them whilst cooking dishes from across the  .\n Sprinkle the bottom of the pie crust with most of the   and most of the  , as well as some of the confit garlic. Give the filling another quick mix to redistribute the spices and pour it into the shell. You should have just enough to fill one pie fully. Sprinkle the top with the rest of the thyme and put it to bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Ten to fifteen minutes in, open the oven, and jiggle the pie. The custard filling should start to set, making it thick enough to support the toppings. If the filling looks a bit thicker, gently toss remnants of the cheese curds and cooked garlic so they stay on top. Clove the oven and cook for 10-15 minutes more. You will know the pie is done once the top stars are browning and the custard is cooked and puffing up.\n Once the cooking is done, let the pie cool before cutting into it. To serve, sprinkle the top with fresh thyme or another herb of your liking. I also made a quick sauce by combining balsamic vinegar, a pinch of sea salt, and wild honey. It makes a fantastic drizzle for the Garlic Guy Pie. The pie goes well with some local drink, like cheap and light  .\n And that is all. Reminder: the recipe comes courtesy of fabulous garlic lover extraordinaire Rab Bitnez, with some minor alterations by yours truly. I implore you to give this pie a try; it might surprise you.\n Until we cook together again,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n , the Jewel of the Vale. A lovely city to visit, and it's not far from  . Imagine you are waking up at a cozy inn with the first rays of sun cheerfully prancing along the glittering waters of the  . You find the latest issue of   and sit down by the water with a handful of freshly-fried  -fried hand-buns filled with gravy,  , and   from a river-side bakery\u2014true   bliss.\n Anyone who's ever visited Berdusk knows of  , a local specialty, sold virtually on every corner and served for morningfeast, highsunfeast, and eveningfeast alike. This is an easy but finicky recipe that you will not regret learning. A typical meal in Berdusk consists of a plateful of goldenstars, a healthy serving of stew, or a platter of fried sausages,  , and  , all drowned in thick chicken gravy.\n Dough:\n As in so many cases with dough, we can prepare it ahead of time. The same can be said with chicken drumsticks that we'll roast to serve with fried bacon, sausage, and cabbage sprouts. Make a quick marinade using  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , salt and pepper. Mix well and submerge drumsticks in the marinade. Keep cool overnight. The next day, release your baking dish very generously and bake on high flame for twenty-five minutes, then flip and bake for ten more. Easy. Now dough. Simply mix four tankards full of sifted flour, a spoonful of salt, one and a half tankards of boiling hot water, and half-a tankard of high-proof clear alcohol. Keep working until the dough is smooth. Rub with melted tallow and leave chilled to rest. Make brown gravy with generous amounts of seasoning to your liking and vegetables. Strain and potion them to freeze. Frozen gravy is much easier to add to the stuffing later.\n Stuffing:\n Now \u2013 the stuffing. We will need sausage meat (remove casings if your sausages are already portioned by the butcher), finely diced potatoes, finely diced  , and fresh green  . Separately, fry onions and potatoes in a bit of tallow until golden. Add both vegetables to the sausage, as well as chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Roll your sleeves and mash the meat until mixed well. If you are unsure about seasoning, pinch a small piece of meat stuffing, fry it off, and taste. Cover the stuffing and chill until ready to shape the handpies.\n Divide your dough in two and roll it out as thin as you think you can handle it. It is a dry kind of dough, and it will seal and harden quite well as you fry your pies. Use a cutter to portion out squares of dough. We then will add a spoonful of the meat mixture to each and a piece of frozen gravy. Use water or egg white to seal the dough in a roughly triangle shape. Add fat or vegetable oil to a skillet and pre-heat. When the oil is well heated and rippling, reduce the heat to medium flame and fie your triangles on both sides. Pat your patties dry off of all oil.\n Now beat together four eggs with a small drizzle of water and two spoonfuls of wheat flour. Add salt, and pepper. Now you need to be fast. Dunk your patties in the egg mix, let them absorb the egg, and quickly transfer them one at a time to a pan filled with hot oil. Your eggs will bubble up and cook quickly. Flip, drain, and prepare to serve while they are still hot and golden.\n Serve them in a big generous pile, and toss in any pieces of fluffy fried egg that were leftover or fell off as you fried the bread. Serve with a platter full of fried sausage patties, bacon, drumsticks, and cabbage. I added some sweet-pickled tomatoes as the flavor cut well the sauce-pot worth of yellow chicken gravy that the entire plate is drowned in.\n A beautiful Berduskan morningfeast that can satisfy even the hungriest halfling. If you have goldenstars for any other meal, I recommend you a huge pitcher of   to go along with it.\n A always, dear friends, be fearless in the kitchen and be fearless when you see that exotic food on the menu!\n , and until the next  .\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n If I were to give the City of Splendors,  , yet another title, this time food-related, it would have to be something that honors its long and rich culture of smallbites, breads, fried goods, and many dishes designed to be served with  ,  , mixed drinks, and other more potent slakes. And because of that, you should seek out the  \u2014where there are the guilders, there is good drink, and where there is good drink, there is likely to be a nice smallbite served with it. The   in the\u00a0  of Waterdeep is the Brewers' guildhall as well as an inn, brewery, tavern, and a   shop. Despite the fact that its menu is small, it has some of the best foods to be snacked on while you catch up with good friends or meet new ones. The Good Spirits Saltbreads is one of these smallbites, a sort of grotesque version of an open-faced   made with fresh     (the recipe to come soon!), or dried crusty bread baked with sea salt. The bread is then topped with hot   and  . To be more precise, either a big slab of lengthwise-cut bread is brushed with hot  -style mustard, topped with thinly sliced smoked  , roasted  , or, if it is served to the halflings,  topped with  , a delicacy made with maggots. The bread is then smothered in cheese sauce and baked, served sizzling hot.\n However, I happen to know of a secret menu item that can be ordered at the Good Spirits as a morningfeast: it's the same dish, but made with added eggs, making it a sort of bread-and-cheese pudding, recommended to me by the friendly waitstaff. This recipe entry will feature the basic baked recipe and will offer easy guidance to turn the dish into a morningfeast even if you serve it with a tankard of   or  .\n Good Spirits Saltbreads\n Makes two servings:\n The first step in preparing the dish, either standard or morningfeast, is deciding if you want to make it into bite-sized bits of bread or have an entire loaf sliced lengthwise. For the purposes of this recipe, I used small bits of saltbread that were flavored and then bake-dried. Then, we need to pick the bread that would work the best. The best types of bread used here are bread with flavor: halfling salbread is darker and harder bread baked with sea salt and citrus peel, so it is packed with flavor \u2013 you can use them as they are (the recipe is to come); the alternative is crusty sourdough which is fully flavored, and you can improve it further with white wine or sherry; lastly, if you are using crusty white bread, like   or farmer's loaves, flavoring them is mandatory.\n Flavoring the bread is important, so we will want to brush or soak it in sour white wine or dry sherry, such as   or  . Leaving the bread to dry off is important - once the liquid and alcohol are gone, only the flavor is left behind, and soggy bread will leak into the dish \u2013 something that we do not want to happen. You can put the soaked bread in an oven on low heat and let it dry, flipping it over to make sure it cooks evenly. But if you want to skip that step completely, it is your choice.\n Using a bit of extra butter, grease the cast iron skillets. Lay slices or cubes of bread tightly, filling the entire thing. Make sure your bread is not taller than the cooking dishes, or you will just make a mess. Spread a bit (or much if you prefer) Kara-Tur, or  -style hot peppered mustard on the top of the bread layer. Next, the topping. I know we, the hin, like worms and grubs, but not all races would love to pull that out of their food. So I recommend you use thinly sliced smoked ham or boar roast from the night before. For smaller bite-sized bits of bread, slice the ham as if it were worms into ribbons and curl them on the mustard-slathered bread. Huge slices of bread can be just topped with full slices of ham instead. Of course, fowl meat can be work, or even no meat at all would still taste great. \n Preheat the oven to 400F, and while it is getting ready, we will melt the cheese. We will use two types of cheese and ake it into a sauce to coat the entire bread and fill the skillet. And why not? We will add some cooked shallots to give it more flavor. Melt two tablespoons of butter in a saucepot and cook thinly sliced   with a large leaf of   in the butter until it is soft. Don't be afraid of it developing some color. Make sure the heat is on medium-low flames. Add in two spoonfuls of   and stir it around the pan to fully absorb the butter, and cook it for several minutes to cook the raw flavor out. Now, you will need a whisk. Pour a cup of warm whole   into the pan and whisk to dissolve the flour. Toss handfuls of both cheeses into the milk once it heats up, and mix the entire sauce until the cheese melts and incorporates. Slowly, the flour will thicken, and the cheese will be ready. Taste the sauce and season it with sea salt and black pepper to your liking. Make sure to have some grated gruyere cheese for the topping; mix it with chopped   and  , and just a little bit of salt.\n If you are making the dish with   for morningfeast, there will be an additional step. While the milk is hot, before you start adding the cheese in, beat two eggs well and pour it into a big bowl through a fine sieve to make the mixture much smoother. In a wide metal bowl, add a ladle of the hot milk to the eggs to tamper them and whisk to mix well, slowly adding more. Once the eggs are mixed well, pour the mix back into the pot, and as you add the cheese, do not stop whisking and scraping the bottom of the pot.\n Now, all we need is to assemble the dish. Pour the cheese over the bread and ham. Top the mix with the rest of the cheese with herbs and cook the skillets at 400F for 20 minutes or until the sauce is set.\n Serve still hot, with a glass of wine and a dish of pickles to eat with the cheese bread bites. Simple and delicious.\n Happy eating! Keep your eyes open for the halfling salbread recipe to be shared soon. It might be my favorite bread I've baked so far, but I am a tiny bit biased, being a halfling myself.\n , and until the next tenday,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good  , my friends. Is there a better meal than morningfeast? Absolutely not... Apart from highsunfeast and eveningfeast, of course. Waking up and having a platterful of hot delicious foods in front of you every day is something to strive for and save your adventuring coming to pay for in your retirement. Today's simple recipe comes from  , who served it back in the day in  . If you've not heard of Illistyl, you must've heard of her adventuring troupe \u2013 the famed  , and she was a student of  . \n The hearty morningfeast dish is made with all things bought locally in Shadowdale. Sweet  , sweet  , fresh  , black  , grilled  , with some   and  , and a sprinkle of  . The eggs are served in thick stewed tomato broth, a bowl of simple  , a side of grilled tomatoes or other vegetables, flatbreads, cheese, and black sausages, all steaming hot.\n I will not repeat a flatbread recipe nor the onion soup, as we've made both before. But I will share with you that this time around, I used   and sweet onions, all chopped and cooked until golden in butter, and later drowned in beef stock and cooked with a pinch of  , a pinch of   and I kept the soup fatty as it makes it so much cozier to sip on a cold winter morning. Flatbreads are simply made with flour, salt, and hot water.\n Tomato broth (2 servings):\n Let us begin by washing tomatoes and cutting out its stem, and on the bottom of the fruit, make a cross-cut. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and submerge tomatoes into it for just three minutes. You will see when it's time to take them out when the skin begins to peel on the cross-cut starts. While the tomatoes are cooling, finely grate the onion and reserve the juice.\n On a frying pan, drizzle one teaspoon of   (don't use extra virgin as it will turn bitter), and toss roughly chopped garlic in the oil along with a single   filet. On medium-low heat, cook until the anchovy falls apart, then add grated onions and pour in any reserved onion juice. Cook on the same flame until onions turn golden, regularly stirring to avoid any burning but caramelization is acceptable. Roughly dice the tomato and reserve any tomato juice and seeds spilled in the process, then add it all to the pan. Reduce the heat and cook covered, occasionally stirring to avoid any burning. The tomatoes will soften after at least twenty minutes of stewing.\n You will know when they are ready \u2013 when pressed down with a fork, they will turn into mush. Use a masher or a spoon to mash everything in a pan. Add some pepper and sprinkle with salt. Taste and adjust flavor and seasoning to taste. All tomatoes are different, and if you use starchy tomatoes, you might want to add a bit of water to make them less mushy. If your tomatoes are not acidic enough, add   juice to balance the taste, and if they are not sweet or tomato-y enough \u2013 stir in a bit of tomato paste. Cover and continue simmering it until it's ready to be served. We want the tomatoes to remain hot.\n Eggs (2 servings):\n We will be using three large eggs per person. In the  , they use  ,  , or even   eggs, but if a   is all you've got \u2013 it's perfectly serviceable. Melt   on low flame in a frying pan and add the eggs with all other ingredients above whipped together. As the eggs are very slowly being cooked, you need to continuously stir them simultaneously while moving the skillet around the flame. Continue to move the mixture around the pan, scraping the bottom. Remove the eggs from the heat when they start to come together but are still soft and gooey.\n Now to plate it all quickly while everything is still hot. Spoon eggs into serving bowls and ladle hot tomatoes onto the eggs. The hot liquid will continue cooking them, so if you don't like your eggs soft, just keep them in the broth longer. Sprinkle sliced green onions and serve. \n I made four flatbreads to go with the eggs and grilled some sweet tomatoes, sprinkling them with some sea salt and a drizzle of olive oil. A small bowl of piping onion soup on the side. Sadly, I could not find black sausage to fry alongside the rest of the morningfeast, but any meat would work.\n This hot mix of eggs and tomatoes can be spooned on the flatbread, and if you like your eggs gooey, you can spread them as if they were toast.\n Dear friends, I will be traveling and will end up in   in the next two  , but I will try and deliver some Baldurian dishes; if not recipes, I will at least try and do some testing of some of the dishes I have prepared.\n If you see me in an eatery somewhere in the Gate, please, do not be shy, come say hi!\n Until next time.  ,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Ah,  . This  , my dear friends, we are going back to the so-called Empire of the Sands. To be honest, I simply can't stay away. Interestingly enough, \"Empire of the Sands\" is a misnomer as the nation is green. Just as green as what we are making today. Why is the land of forests called the Empire of the Sands, you ask? I was once told that the title was created by leaders of   a long, long time ago as a way to attract northern tourists. But I cannot guarantee you that this statement is in any way accurate.\n We made meals from Tethyr; many of them have a certain green freshness, and simple peasant fare in Tethyr is not much different. The Tethyrian coastal dish and/or term \" \", is a type of a morningfeast made out of the previous day's leftovers\u2014scraps of vegetables, meats, sometimes  , all fried with   and  . Highsunfest brings another way of using up leftovers: meats,  ,  ,  ,  , all drenched in a green simmersauce of   or   and hot green  . But what will happen if we want to have kedgeree as a highsunfest but do not want cold leftover pies? Well, we make a stew\u2014kedgeree in green simmersauce! Let us begin!\n Stew (4 servings):\n First things first, we need to prepare all the vegetables and meat. Start by cleaning the round or brisket, whichever you have handy. Remove silverskins and excess fat. Cube the meat into roughly inch-sized cubes. Toss the meat in half a teaspoon of salt and black pepper and lay them out on paper towels for 30 minutes. Let the salt be reabsorbed, and the surface dry up just a bit. While you wait, dice up cooked  ,  , and   into roughly evenly sized cubes. Dice one carrot finely. Use a grater to shred an entire   into a bowl and reserve the juices.\n With just a sprinkle of neutral oil, brown the meat cubes on all sides. Do not crowd the pan. Set aside and reserve juices. Do not wipe the fat off; instead, throw in the shredded onion and its juices and cook on high heat until it softens. Remove from heat and deglaze the pan with a bit of chicken stock. In a soup pot, toss in a tiny bit of oil and sweat carrots and parsnips for 5 minutes on medium-low heat. Add in ham, beef, onion,  ,   powder, white pepper,  , and  , as well as two stalks of lemongrass, after you smack it with the blunt edge of a knife a few times. Add half a large spoonful of salt, but it's up to you how much you want to use. Pour in two quarts of   stock; note it will get darkened by all the spices. You can use beef stock, too, but it will make the stew look darker and muddier. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and leave to simmer for about an hour.\n Meanwhile, roughly chop up your chilies, lightly oil a sheet pan, and toss the chilies with garlic on it. Bake them at 450\u00a0\u00b0F for 20 minutes, but keep an eye on the peppers. We want them softened and slightly charred but not turned into cinders and crisps. Mince one baked pepper and add it to the stew; put the rest, along with garlic cloves, into a bowl to be ground or into a fanciful device that will turn them into a paste. Wilt the   on a hot skillet until it softens and add it to the peppers. Add fresh herbs,   zest, and  . Blitz them all together into a green simmer paste. Cover tightly with film to avoid oxidation.\n Now that it's been simmering for an hour, add the cubed potatoes and cook for 30 more minutes. Let the liquid evaporate, but don't let it fall below the meat and vegetables' level. Once the potatoes are soft, scoop the still-hot stew into serving bowls and spoon into it three or four spoonfuls of the simmersauce, mix, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Don't forget to remove bay leaves and lemongrass. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and some leftover toasted bread and butter from the night before. If you do not want a bright green color, add the simmer sauce to the stew and simmer it all together for 5 minutes before serving, but, admittedly, it will look darker and muddier.\n As expected, kedgeree is hearty and the simmersauce gives it that fresh herbal taste oh so popular in Tethyr. This recipe does have a significant downside: even though you can keep and freeze the stew itself, the simmersauce needs to be made fresh every time you reheat the leftovers. Herbs go rancid quickly and will turn black if frozen.\n I hope you enjoyed this tenday's dish. The next recipe is going to be sweet riverfish from the  .\n It has been a long day, my friends.  , and until the next time we cook,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n And as promised, we are continuing making   from the huge loaf of   we baked a tenday ago. Last time, we celebrated   with sweet dried fruit bread pudding; this time \u2013 it is all going to be savory with hints of natural sweetness that goes great with sugar bread.\n Sembia is home to several species of succulent sweet-fleshed  , both freshwater and from the sea. It also has access to sweet, juicy   corn from  . These two elements are brought together with a mildly spiced, savory, and sweet bread pudding, oh so common across the country due to its relatively low cost.\n We will need a cast   grill pan or an outdoor grill for the corn. Crab can be used freshly caught and shelled, or you can use some chopped jarred crab if fresh is not available.\n Bread pudding (3 generous servings):\n Beat together   and spices until smooth. Slowly add warm   and cream in, beating the mix with a whisk until fully incorporated. Cube the stale bread; we need it to be dry as it will absorb the liquid better. If you are using fresh bread, cube it and pop it into an oven at a low temperature to dry it out. Roughly chop the crab meat. If you are using canned or jarred crab \u2013 drain it well and, sprinkle with a tiny pit of  . Spread it in a sieve or colander or paper towels to let it drain well.\n Lightly brush the grill and heat it up. Grill corn on all sides, regularly turning them to develop flavor and darken. It will take a long time to develop defining scorch marks, depending on the grilling method. My hot cast iron grill took around 35-40 minutes. Once you are satisfied with the color, let the corn cool. Using a sharp knife and a large bowl, cut the cooked kernels off the cob. Keep the cob at the 90-degree angle, holding it at the top and cutting it down through the kernels.\n Use unsalted butter to grease ramekins generously. In a separate bowl, mix together bread, corn, and crab. Spoon the stuffing in. Mix and whisk the eggs again until frothy. Carefully spoon the mixture over the bread, filling the ramekins fully. If you don't like dry bread on top, soak the cubes in the mix beforehand and then spoon them into buttered ramekins. Try to ensure the crab and corn even distribution. Finally, you can add 1/2 tankard of shredded cheese to the mix, but that is optional.\n Bake them in a preheated oven at 375F for about 25 minutes. The pudding is ready when it's puffed up in the oven, and the egg mix is giggly but does not look wet. If you want to avoid cheese becoming too dark, top the ramekins with a handful of mixed shredded cheese  15 minutes into the baking.\n As an accompaniment to dip into or pour over \u2013 I brought leftover common mushroom gravy to a quick boil and added a heaping teaspoon full of thinly sliced   in oil. A little bit of butter to finish the gravy \u2013 while it is still hot, simply stir it in as the butter melts. Taste and adjust the seasoning and serve on the side.\n And this is all I have for you this tenday. We used up leftover sugarbread and made a Sembite treat.\n I hope you celebrate the winter festivals with your family and friends.  \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Well met, fellow travelers and pursuers of culinary experiences from across  . This  , we are returning to the nation of   and to the shaded floral oasis of civilization in the sea of forest.   We have visited the   before and tried the strange  -packed   stew. Well, this is one of many dishes the eatery is known for. Today's recipe is  , made, as is common in Tethyr, with generous heapings of   and sometimes other herbs. We've learned that mint is essentially one of the staples of Tethyrian cuisine, probably thanks to all the forest people,   and   and some such.\n Wine   are stuffed with meat and abundantly flavored with mint. However, I do not have the tools to stuff and case my sausages, so we will improvise. We will cook sweet herby sausages in red  , heavily infused with fresh mint. The dish is sometimes served as a side dish during feasts at the Boon alongside the bowl of  . I like ordering a skillet of sausages as a morningfeast. We will need a small cast-  skillet to cook and serve the dish in, as well as a bowl to keep a herby mint sauce on the side. Let us begin.\n . Mint-wine sausages (makes 1 serving):\n Begin by preheating the cast iron on low flame with oil and butter in it. Finely dice one   and, if you decide to go the optional route, one small leek's white parts. Add them into the cast iron skillet and let them slowly cook, soften, and develop color and sweetness. Meanwhile, score the casing on two sweet sausages at an angle, as we don't want them to shrink. On high flames, sear sausages on both sides until they are nicely golden brown. You don't need to cook them through \u2013 we are just for the color. Remove the sausages, set aside, and wipe the oil. Add a dash of wine to deglaze and scrape the fond. Do not do that if the pan is blackened and burned! Set aside \u2013 we will add it in with the wine later. Cut up sweet bell peppers into strips. Red and yellow are preferred colors. Add a dash of oil to a skillet, and on high heat, sear the sliced peppers, flipping them around to achieve even color. Don't forget to sprinkle them with a bit of salt. They will slightly soften and develop charred skin in spots in about four minutes, but much quicker if you do not crowd the skillet. Once some color and blackened spots appear, remove from the heat and set aside.\n Next, we will start assembling the main skillet. By this time, your shallots should be soft and fragrant. Split your olives in two, then set aside half and quarter them. I used black and green olives, but the original recipe called for black only. Roughly chop the mint. Add all the wine and reserved deglazing liquid to the skillet on top of the cooked shallots. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Add chopped mint. Important note: we will cook mint in wine; in the end, it will be dark and unsightly. If you want your dish to look smoother and you don't want to eat wine-boiled herbs, pack mint into a cheesecloth pouch, tie it up, and submerge it in the wine sauce to cook. When it's ready, you can remove the herbs and keep the minty fresh flavor. Add olives. You can reserve some to add to the dish when serving.\n Simmer the sauce down until it's reduced by about one-third and thickened a bit from the vegetables. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper. If you like the sauce to be a bit thicker, mix a small spoon of   starch with wine and add it to the sauce. Now add the sausages and peppers, make sure they are mostly submerged, and simmer them in the sauce. It should take ten to fifteen minutes, depending on how pre-cooked were peppers and sausages. Remember to turn the sausages and peppers over to avoid a dry top. Mind the stove \u2013 the wine will splatter everything around the skillet.\n The sauce will dye the sausages, and the wine will thicken\u2014perfect for scooping it with  . But while the sausages are cooking, we will make a nice mint sauce to go on grilled bread. I like topping an open-faced   of wine sausages with peppers, a dollop of sauce, and this fresh, herby mint sauce.\n Herb-mint sauce (makes one bowl):\n Roughly chop all ingredients and use a food processor to blend them into coarse mush. Taste, season to taste, give it another stir and scoop into a bowl. Grill some bread or make pre-sliced croutons.\n Now to serve: simply take the skillet off the flames and serve to table, still bubbling. Sprinkle with some chiffonaded mint. We used two types of wines, one sweet, like   (good to serve with the dish), and dry, like  .\n Breakfast of adventurers and   champions. Don't worry; by this time, all alcohol has been evaporated. You can easily scale the recipe up one-to-one, but the cooking times will increase, and it will take longer to reduce the sauce.\n This is all I have for you this time, friends. Be sure to stop at the Oak-Father's Boon if you are passing Mosstone; you will not regret it.\n Next time, I will bring you a tavern smallbite recipe, to no surprise, again from Tethyr, and we will try to make a pastry from   at the tenday's end.\n  and stay well-fed, friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n  is the topic of this  's entry into  . This variety of especially pungent   has as many haters as it does fans. Some dislike its sharp taste, while others appreciate its unique flavor. I like to think of various types of blue cheese as more inventive and extreme ways to ferment, as my family is well familiar with. This particular recipe is traditionally made with  \u2014the aptly named cheese produced in the town of  , which we've visited before for our look at  's   buns. An acceptable alternative would be   Blue, but not everyone can hop the   when buying groceries. Beregost Blue recently became a well-known product that can be found in the markets of   as well as other settlements in the  . Even though its flavor is strong, it seems to be in high demand, possibly due to a good marketing campaign that claims that Beregost Blue is unique thanks to a special strain of bacteria the cheesemakers cultivate and inject into fresh cheese and aging for an undisclosed period of time. Maybe Master Traveler   can dig up some of Beregost's secrets in his next   installment. But until then, all I can say is that the bacteria, or mold, with a fanciful name, is a secret discovered about a century and a half ago, allegedly in some damp and creepy cavern connected to the  . With the cheese's popularity growing beyond   and pretentious epicures, common folk started adding it to foods, beginning with some local types of dumplings made out of  . This dish is a combination of boiled and fried dumplings in either ball or flat pancake shapes, with cheese carefully melted into cream and then mixed with some seasonings and healthy spoonfuls of thick   gravy. The colors, thickness, and taste balance between mushrooms and blue cheese vary from kitchen to kitchen, as well as the sauce's brownness. I like the sauce to have a stronger blue cheese flavor, so its color will be a very light brown. For a darker color, all you will need is to cut the amount of cream and increase the amount of cheese and gravy, so I suggest you play around with the measurements and do not forget to taste as you go! Shall we begin?\n Dumplings\n Makes approximately 20 dumplings:\n Like with many other recipes that involve dough or dumplings, these potato treats can be made ahead and frozen, as you will need to chill the dumplings after shaping them anyway. The main question for an aspiring cook is what types of potatoes are best to use, and of course, opinions differ across regions. My preferred method is a combination of all-purpose potatoes, like something they call Yukon Gold on Earth, or starchy potatoes, but both, I believe, need an added waxy potato. A single one, just to give the dumplings a bit of creaminess. However, it will make them a bit harder to form due to the dough's stickiness.\n Let us begin by filling the pot with water and boiling the potatoes, whole, not peeled, for about forty minutes (less if the potatoes are individually on a smaller size). You pierce a potato with a fork, and you will feel it entering a tuber like it were warm butter \u2013 that is how you know the potatoes are done. Run them under cold water and let them cool enough to handle.\n Once the potatoes have cooled a bit and are dry, you can easily peel them with a paper towel pulled down with a bit of pressure. They will just slide off. You will just need to remove the little eyes from the tubers. Next, we will need to puree the potatoes. A vegetable ricer or a sieve would be enough. Sift a cup of all-purpose flour into a big bowl and start mixing it in with the potatoes. Slowly add one whole   and one additional egg yolk into the bowl, as well as  ,  , and dried  . Mix until eggs and flour are incorporated into the potato mash. The mixture will look sticky. Let it rest a bit in the cool storage before shaping.\n Prepare your workstation: have a cutting board covered with one sheet of cooking wax paper. Take the dough bowl out of the cooling storage. You might want to dip your fingers into oil to stop the dough from sticking. Roll a bit of dough and flatten it with your thumb. The size is not important, but a button-like shape with an indentation in the middle would be helpful to hold the sauce. The ball of dough should be about what you can hold in the ring of your index finger and thumb. And the thickness of a thin pancake. Lay them on a sheet of wax paper and cover them with another. Transfer into the ice box so they harden or for them to be stored for future use. You will need at least 20 minutes to chill them or more to freeze.\n To cook the dumplings, prepare a pot of salted water and bring it to a rolling boil. While it is getting heated, prepare a non-stick skillet big enough to hold at least one serving of the dumplings - four ot five pieces. Melt a spoonful of butter in it and keep it hot on medium-low flame so when the dumplings are boiled, they can get that quick caramelization. Once the water is boiling, drop in frozen dumplings, just a handful at a time, or the water temperature will drop too much. Reduce the flame just to make the boiling gentler and cook the dumplings in it. They are done quickly, in a couple of minutes. Once the dumplings float up, fish them out, shake or drain water, and drop them into a pan with butter. Fry on both sides to develop a golden color and plate. But remember that we need the sauce. You should start working on the sauce and have it almost completely done before boiling the dumplings.\n Beregost Blue sauce\n Makes two generous or four humble servings:\n First, as I mentioned before, this sauce has different levels of \"brownness.\" To concentrate the flavor, use thickened gravy and reduce it in a simmering pot. We will need only three or four spoonfuls. My measurements lead to a light brown colored sauce, and for that, use a quarter cup of   and a quarter cup of full-fat  . Add them to a skillet and gently heat them up. Do not boil. Add chopped or crumbled blue cheese into the dairy and stir it in until it all melts into the sauce. Season with   powder, cayenne, and nutmeg. Stir in thickened and reduced gravy to the desired color. More gravy will need more blue cheese to compensate for the flavor. Stir to incorporate and taste. Lastly, roughly chop the green onions and stir them into the sauce, allowing them to wilt for a few minutes in the hot sauce.\n We do not need to go over caramelized onions or gravy, so let's just plate. Place four or five pan-fried dumplings on a plate. Spoon over the blue cheese gravy and top with caramelized   and crumbled  .\n As a side dish for the sauced dumplings, I made a simple salad of lettuce, roughly chopped  , sliced pepperoncini,  , and shaved Parmigiano Reggiano with a drizzle of extra virgin  .\n And just like that, the meal is ready. You can have it as an eveningfeast or a highsun snack. Just do not forget to order some nice ale or wine to go with it. This meal is a delight, and I highly recommend you try it.\n That is all I have for you. Next time, we are traveling to the   to partake in one of its traditional rice bowls.\n Until then,\n , my dear reader,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Today, like every self-respecting halfling, I am craving good ale, good fry, and good spice. So today\u2019s dish is very familiar to anyone traveling the  . What is more abundant than fish and fries in the eateries and pubs of  ,  , and  ? Well, freshly fried fish. Some get to be seasoned and fried whole to be munched on with spiced ales, while others get dunked and battered and sauced.\n I\u2019ve passed the City of Splendors many months ago, and what I found peculiar is the sauces they serve with such fried marine grub. This particular meal comes from the famed  . If you\u2019re an adventuring sort, a heroic thrill-seeker, or a fortune-finder like my dear brother Porto, you\u2019ve spent many-a-night at the Portal and had the pleasure of meeting  , the grumpy proprietor of the fine establishment. Its ever-changing menu had battered fish the night of my visit. Nothing special about the fish. Whitefish served with battered  , but a duo of bickering cooks,   and   whipped up a batch of what they called   to be smudged atop the fishfry. My research uncovered that the sauce originated from sweltering   where it was prepared with handfuls of hot peppers, but Waterdeep\u2019s version used more commonly available  . So let\u2019s talk about how to make this easy sauce\u2026 and the fish too, I suppose.\n You can use any fish for this fry. Fatty fish goes better with horseradish, but flat and white fish such as   or   is what they used at the Yawning Portal. First things first: slice the fish and a vegetable of your choice (zucchini, in my case) into somewhat uniform flat slices to help with cooking times. Toss them with salt and pepper and leave them be. What we want is for the salt to draw excess liquid out of the things we are frying. We will dab them dry before battering, so be ready to make a bit of a mess.\n While the salt is doing its magic, make ale batter. You want to use a cup of nice thick-bodied bready beer or ale. Mix it with a cup and a handful of flour, egg, salt, pepper, hot pepper flakes, and powdered garlic, and stir it all together until all clumps are gone. Prepare a plate with flour with a dash of salt and pepper for dusting.\n When you know your fish and vegetables and well-dried and dabbed, dust them with flour, dip them in batter and throw them into a pre-heated frying oil cauldron. If you are like me, pan-frying is an option, but instead of getting fluffy bits, you will be left with flattened pancake-like pieces. Both fish and zucchinis cook quickly, so keep an eye out and take out once the batter is dark golden and crispy. Let the freshly fried bits rest and drop oil on a wire rack and serve as soon as you can, maybe a minute after you take them out. Serve the blood sauce on the side and sprinkle with crispy fried garlic, onions, or leeks.\n Now, lets talk about the star of the event\u2014the blood sauce. You can make it ahead of time, and the ladies at the Yawning Portal cooked it in a massive pot that was bigger than a well-fed halfling. You will need tomatoes, preferably from down south, hot peppers from the Vilhon or Maztica, bell peppers, garlic, horseradish, salt, a dash of sugar, and a drizzle of lemon juice. You can remove tomato skin by putting them into boiling water for a minute, but it\u2019s not necessary. For horseradish, you will have to grate or purchase jarred preserves. Crudely chop all the ingredients and place them on medium heat, cover, and cook until all the vegetables are soft and can be mashed. Remember, the heat of peppers and horseradish reduces as you heat the sauce, so make sure to save some minced and mashed on the side to add at the end when the blood sauce is chilled. When everything is soft, remove the cover, mash, and cook until the liquid evaporates, leaving a thick sauce behind. For me, it took about 2 hours, but my pot was also snack-sized.\n When the sauce is thick and reduced, take it off the flame and let it chill. When cold, add in seasoning, acid, mashed peppers, and horseradish to taste. Serve the delicious, refreshing blood sauce cold. But one thing you need to remember if you are planning to jar it and preserve it, you need to make sure everything is heated up and sterile before you seal it for the future.\n And here we go. Boring old fish fry with a lovely bowl of sauce. Feel free to use different ingredients! I\u2019ve heard some made the blood sauce with carrots and apples to add sweetness or smoked and red bell peppers from Maztica that are especially mouth-incinerating.\n Speaking of Maztica, my dear reader. I have a hearty recipe for a bean stew from   to share with you, as well as flaming-hot  . Please remind me if I get distracted.\n Another venture into the relaxing world of Torillian cookery is done. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed our time together. Amarast, as always, Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  , we are continuing our venture into the city of  . The   is a well-known tavern and an inn from the   district, right on  . Despite being a lower-class establishment, it gained some renown after being featured in one of Master  's guides to the city. The food at the Mermaid is simple, too simple, for some more sophisticated gullet. It consisted of stews, seafood,   smothered in drippings, roasts, and alcohol.\n The dish of note we will be making today is Blushing Mermaid's Seaweed Stew. It is made daily in large cauldrons, perpetually boiling all day, ready to dispense the hot briny and savory stew with the cooks shoveling in more seaweed, meat, and fish as more bowls were sold. Some of the ingredients we will need can be quite exotic if you do not live by salty sea waters, but most can be purchased in a dried form; ah, gods bless   for their preserved seafood goods. Apart from the seaweed and water, we will also need cheap chuck   or   steak and white fish with some   or   to shape into fish balls. You can also buy pre-made fish balls if you're running out of time or don't have enough fresh ingredients.\n Stew:\n Begin by breaking your seaweed into pieces slightly longer than your palm and soak it in warm water for ten minutes. Drain the seaweed and wash it several times in running water to clean and wash any sand out. The seaweed will now have changed its color from black to dark green. Slices bigger leaves into pieces about an inch long and roughly cut the rest to be of uniform size. Split the seaweed into two bowls. We will cook one and stew it, and the second part will go in just before we serve the dish.\n Fishballs:\n The next step is to prepare the meats. If you have pre-made fishballs, skip this paragraph. If you're making them from scratch, you will need white   filets, shrimp meat, white pepper, and a dash of salt. Drain your seafood well and mash all the ingredients in a bowl or blend by other mechanical means. You will have a gooey sticky paste. Wash your hands and oil them up, gently forming the mash into tightly-packed balls. Finish by putting them in boiling salty water for two or three minutes. Set them aside to cool.\n Now have your cubed meat and fishballs in a bowl and drizzle with a small spoonful of   and add salt and pepper. Mix well and set aside in a chill place to \"marinade\" for thirty minutes.\n Now let us assemble the dish. Drizzle the rest of the sesame oil on a bottom of a stewing pot and add diced   as well as a handful of baby white  . We do not need color, so cook them on medium-low flames for about 5 minutes, regularly tossing or stirring. Meanwhile, heat up a saut\u00e9ing pan and quickly brown your meat and fish. If you want to add a bit of thickness to the stew, add a big spoon of flour and continue cooking on medium, making sure it absorbs all the oil and makes a roux. Now add the first half of your seaweed and bring the flames up to fry it up. Continue stirring and cook for about eight munites. Now add water. You can also use seafood stock, but the seaweed will release enough taste to make broth on its own. Chop the white part of your green   and add to the stew. Add browned meat and fish balls. Bring the pot to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook covered for at least 30 minutes.\n We are almost done. It's time to add seasoning, mix well, and taste. I noticed that the recipe might take more salt, which seems reasonable, but you have to salt it to extract the flavor from the seaweed. I used  , black  ,   flakes, black lime, and   to flavor. Now if you're satisfied with the taste, stir the rest of your seaweed in to keep its green color.\n To serve, ladle the stew into a bowl and sprinkle it with chopped greens of the green onions. It's best served with a glass of chilled  . Traditionally, it is accompanied by dark   with a spread of butter, spices, sea salt, and roast or sear drippings. But as I didn't have any more nutbread handy, I decided to make a dessert instead out of    . I smothered it center with    , topped it with  's milk   and sliced  . Delectable!\n This stew was a surprising hit, and I will be making more of it soon. This tour of Baldur's Gate is turning out to be quite a treat! Nest   we will make a Balduran morningfeast and the following one \u2013   or as they are fancifully now called \u2013  !\n Until next time,  , and happy cooking!\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Today's meal takes us to the  , one of the few friendly keeps in the lush   floodplains region of  . The small caste and its surrounding buildings are known for their friendliness, and the Hold's guest house has its doors always open to travelers and other guests. It's hard to believe the Arnise Hold was once taken over by monsters, and the lord of the hose was brutally murdered. I say Lady  , the latest Lord of the keep, runs it well into prosperity.\n Among meals offered by the staff were simple and hearty dishes of game found in abundance around the keep. The wild   dumplings are the dish we are talking about today. You will need a handful of wild  , wild boar meat (minced),  , hot  , some stewing tubers, and vegetables, as well as  .\n Boar is hunted in abundance, and you should not have a problem finding a hunter or a butcher with a freshly minced wild pig. You will need to make a dumpling mix using minced boar,  , pepper,  , and  . To bind the filling together, use a small handful of starch, like dried   mash,   crumbs, or cooked  , plus a single    . Roll up your sleeves and mash it all together well with your hands. Set aside.\n In the meantime, put two pots on the stove; one with clear   (or any other stock you have), put in a handful of seasonings, finely diced  , several slices of hot peppers,  ,  , or  . Cook it all together on simmer for at least 30 minutes. In the second pot, cook two handfuls of finely chopped wild mushrooms in   and stock or water until it's dark. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then cook until reduced to a dark brown thick liquid. Add chopped garlic,  ,  , potatoes, and a handful of  ,  , and  . If you\u2019re feeling especially adventurous, use   berries that go well with game! This stew will need to cook for an hour at least until it's thick and creamy \u2013 perfect for dipping your dumplings into.\n Now let's talk about the dumpling dough. A modern   might not have time to make her own dough so find yourself a good baker who would be willing to roll the wrappers out and cut them in uniform shapes. If you do feel so inclined, the dumpling dough I used here only needs flour, egg, cold water, and starch for rolling. Simple but time-consuming.\n The next step will be a labor-intensive one. Each of the wrappers will need to be filled with the boar mince you set aside earlier. Remember not to use more than a flange-sized scoop of meat. Place it in the center, then wet all the sides of the wrapper with water, using your fingers if you so desire. Bring the sides up, and press them firmly together to glue the dumpling sealed. There are several shapes you could make, but the presentation is not as important as the taste in such rustic dishes.\n When you\u2019re finished, divide the dumplings into how you want them prepared. For the dumplings you will be serving in soup \u2013 place them in the clear soup you made earlier and cook on low heat until ready. Fifteen minutes should be enough. DO NOT BOIL, or the dumplings will fall apart \u2013 these wrappers are very delicate. As the main star of the show \u2013 melt some wild boar tallow in a skillet, then lay eight dumplings at a time in hot fat to fry them. Each side takes about 2 minutes to brown. The last step is what gives them a crunchy crust. Take a cup of water and dissolve half a tablespoon of flour in it, then pour it into the skillet. Cook covered for five minutes. Then take off the cover and continue cooking until the flour liquid turns into a crust.\n Now it's ready. Flip the pan with a plate covering it, and here you have it. Break the crunchy crust and serve!  The fried dumplings can be dipped in the mushroom stew you made earlier. Yum! (However, the Arnise Hold used game meat stew, not vegetable and mushroom). On the side, you have a bowl of dumpling soup with some refreshing heat \u2013 perfect for the autumn. And a plate piled high with dumplings. They were usually served with fried smoked fish and fried boar belly or bacon, but that is for another day.\n I hope you enjoyed this dish as much as I did, my dear friends.\n Until next time, Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n   This  's recipe has a star: the sauce. Hot, sweet sauce full of red    , flavored with dried   peppers and wild    . The nation of the dreaded   is renowned for its huge selection of hot peppers\u2014red, of course, like everything else is there. Grown in Thay's magically controlled climate, the country's markets are usually filled with a variety of red peppers of various shapes, hues, and sizes and with different heat levels and aftertastes. The two most famous sauces made in Thay are red pepper sauce, which in practice is much more random in preparation than many vendors and cooks would ever admit. The second is Thayan green pepper sauce, made with green peppercorns and is exclusively used in savory dishes.\n Today, we are making a quick batch of Thayan red pepper sauce. This particular recipe comes from the   in  , from before it was more commonly known as Burning Amruthar. This sauce was ladled onto your plates with most things on offer from the inn's kitchen. Most commonly, with fried rice, grilled or roasted meats, and, of course, a variety of dumplings, usually made and cooked to order by quickly packing a bit of filling into the dough and throwing them into a boiling pot or a steamer. But the dumplings in this recipe are simply called Cook's Special Dumplings\u2014the culinary creation of  , a   tasked with cooking for slave   at the arena run by\u00a0 , a\u00a0foul Red Wizard and an enemy of Old Bones   himself! But who isn't Tam's enemy nowadays? He managed to anger folk from   to  . But I digress. The Cook had to make food using whatever he had handy, as no Red Wizard would really care what they fed to their slaves. So the dwarf found a way to give a bit of a magical boost to the gladiators he befriended by making some of his special dumplings for them, using   flour, a bunch of minced myconid flesh from the  , the\u00a0myconid\u00a0 , and had them steamed to perfection. I am unsure of what came of the Concocter and the Cook, as it has been over a century since that dish was created. But I decided to make the dumplings with a much lighter wrapping \u2013 using rice paper that was originally invented in   and made its way to the   a few decades back. We will use a handful of various mushrooms as well as some herbs as a filling. Most of us don't have a willing myconid nearby anyway. So, let's begin!\n Thayan Pepper Sauce\nMakes two servings:\n The sauce preparation is easy. Begin by adding a drizzle of   to a pan and cooking   on medium-low heat, constantly moving it around the pan for a few minutes. Then, add the peppers and toast them in oil for a couple of minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. Add   chopped in thin rings very last.\n Mix and ensure the sauce has enough acidity and just a dash of saltiness. Heat, lemongrass, and peppers are the main flavors. You can add a drizzle of   to add some flavor complexity and saltiness. Continue simmering the sauce for thirty minutes on medium-low flame, regularly stirring. Transfer the sauce to a bowl and let it cool.\n Dumplings:\nMakes two servings:\n Begin by preparing the mushrooms. It is better to clean them off any dirt and soil with a side towel instead of washing them in water. Mushrooms are sponges and will absorb too much, making the next step in cooking the moisture out longer than it has to be. Different mushrooms can be used as long as we keep some for flavor \u2013 like shiitake and umami, and some for texture, like cremini and oyster. I ended up making two attempts at the dumplings due to broken rice paper. The first version had bigger, chunkier mushrooms, while the second one had them finely minced. I have to say that bigger dice and one layer of rice paper look better on the dish, but fine rice and two layers are sturdier and won't fall apart on you into the sauce. I also used up some of my dried black fungus for this recipe as it doesn't have much taste and serves as a good filler.\n Finely dice your mushrooms and stir-fry them in a bit of sesame or vegetable oil for about four or five minutes. Do not crowd the pan, or it will take much more time, up to 10 minutes, to cook the mushroom mince evenly. Do the same with finely chopped onion or shallots; saut\u00e9 them until they become soft and sweet. Once the mushrooms and onions are done and cooled, combine them in a single bowl, adding finely minced   and  , reserving some of the herbs for presentation. Add   and oyster sauce and season with salt and black pepper.\n Fill the steamer with water, and feel free to add a bit of flavor if you feel like going the extra mile: a tablespoon of soya sauce and aromatic herbs and spices, like ginger, would add a nice flavor to the steam. While the steamer is coming to a boil, cut out parchment paper to line the steamer and assemble the dumplings.\n Use one sheet of rice paper for a delicate look or two for a thicker and sturdier cover. Place the first sheet on a cutting board and brush it with water, flip it over, and brush again. For two layers, place the second sheet on top and bush it with water as well. The rice paper will absorb the water quickly, so continue moistening them until the paper becomes soft. You could also soak the paper in water instead, but it makes it harder to handle, and you risk it disintegrating completely.\n When ready to add the filling, gently push out any bubbles of iron stuck between two sheets and add a tablespoonful of mushroom filling to the top side of the rice paper ring. Fold the rice paper over the filling once from the top. Then, fold the sides in towards each other. Now, all you need to do is roll the dumpling down, wrapping it twice. Lightly brush the parchment paper with oil and settle all the dumplings into the steamer, making sure they do not touch. If they touch, the rice paper will stick together and rupture the dumpling. Place the steaming rack into a steamer on a rolling boil and cook covered for nine minutes.\n When done, place four cooked dumplings on a bed of butter lettuce, sprinkle them with chopped scallions and thinly shaved carrots, and pile a healthy spoonful of red pepper sauce over them. Of course, six dumplings per serving are also acceptable, and a side of clear broth and some spicy pickled vegetables is a good side. This light dish is somewhere between highsunfeast and a handfood snack, so a good stein of cold amber   would go well with the hot red sauce. A halfling in me wants to see lamb ribs marinated in the Thayan sauce and baked to perfection. Maybe next time.\n And this is all for the tenday. Next, we will be making some   bread! \n  and until next time,\n Your Friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n After a long break and saying goodbye to a loved one, a fellow  , and a hero, I am back, and I am bringing you yet another dish from my travels. This  's recipe is from the lovely guest house of the   in  , just east of  . We've already covered one other staple from the keep \u2013 De'Arnise wild boar dumplings. This time, we have a  -friendly dish of spiced grilled   that grow in abundance all around the keep and Lady De'Arnise's lands \u2013 large meaty   and  , served on a bed of  . As I shared with you last year, the hosts of the De'Arnise guest house and the nicest people and the keep's cook eagerly spent some time talking shop, exchanging recipes over a pitcher of local   and a tray of     rolled in   and cooked in  . The recipe was inherited from the 14  century staff and improved by the current generation, using spices and   from Athkatla's markets. The mushrooms are brushed in a mix of spices and   as well as   mash, grilled as if the mushrooms were    , while barley is boiled and cooked with various flavorings, including hard aged cheese and additional flavor brought to it in the very end, with glazed and grilled spiced mushrooms.\n Grilled Mushrooms\nMakes two servings:\n We begin by making the spiced paste to smother the mushrooms with. Combine miso paste (a tasty and savory flavoring export from  ) and finely mashed garlic. Cram the two together until they are incorporated. Add a teaspoon of grilling oil to the mix and the rest of the ingredients. Mix them until a thick and flavorful paste forms. If you are using dried   instead of hot pepper sauce or pepper puree, add a teaspoon of water or stock and incorporate it to help with spreading it over the mushrooms. We are looking for soft paste you can spread with a brush; thicker paste would have to be plastered with a spoon. Also, note that a thinner paste flavors the mushrooms better.\n Now, we can prepare large browncaps or crag mushrooms. Use a side towel, brush all the soil from the caps, and quickly rinse the mushrooms in cold running water. Do not soak them; mushrooms are like a sponge, and we don't want water on the grill. Cut the stems off, and, using a  , prick the mushroom caps to help with the penetration of the \"marinade\" paste. Cover the mushrooms in the spice paste and let them absorb the flavor while covered. A few hours would be great, but just thirty minutes can work if you are in a rush. Grilling is quick, so while the mushrooms are marinating, we can start preparing barley.\n Barley\nMakes two servings:\n We are using rolled barley for this recipe, and it generally doesn't need soaking in cold water for more than 30 minutes. If you have pearl barley, just wash the berries and soak them in cold water for 50 minutes before cooking.\n The first step in this part of the dish is to finely dice half of an onion bulb and cook it in oil until the onions turn dark golden. Keeping the onions in the same cooking pot, add soaked barley, but drain the starchy water out. While the flames are still on medium strength, continue cooking and stirring the barley and onions for about five minutes.\n Reduce the flame to medium-low and pour in chicken stock. Let the barley simmer in the stock and stir the pot as you add a pinch of salt and pepper, lemon juice, and some of the grated parmesan. Slowly stir and cook, gradually adding all of the cheese. The total cooking time would be about 45 minutes. Do not forget to taste as you go. You might need more stock and more cheese to balance the flavor to your liking or if the barley is too hard and needs a bit more cooking time.\n While the barley is simmering, heat up the cast-iron grill pan and brush it with grilling oil. Remove the mushrooms from the paste and brush any excess, leaving just a thin layer on. Some of it will be baked on the grill as you cook, but that is fine as long as you clean the cast iron pan right after it cools. Grill mushrooms for about five minutes per side. You will know the mushrooms are ready when they have grill marks and become much darker in color,\n The last step is cooking spinach and young greenspears, which will take mere minutes if you want to keep the leaves vibrant green. Wash the spinach and greenspears. Dice the swords and, together with spinach, gently fold the fresh leaves into barley and stir for two more minutes. Turn off the heat and get ready to serve.\n Scoop two spoonfuls of barley onto a plate and shape them into a shallow well. Top the barley with two grilled mushrooms. Flake off any charred bits of the spice paste. The spice paste from the mushrooms will add more flavor and sweetness to the barley.\n This dish pairs well with elvish   or some fresh, shimmering green   from Arnise Hold's own tiny winery. This is all I have for you this tenday, my friends. I still need to check my notes to see if there are other dishes from Lady De'Arnise's keep I could share. But until then,  .\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n No surprises here, but we are, once again, traveling down the   to visit  . This time, the traveling was done relatively recently, just this past  . I went out of my way to jump in with a caravan that was taking a long four-day stop at this  . I took the opportunity to visit   to purchase some exotic Southern     and a set of terrifying red   that looks like a stylish  , lightly   for defense and, of course, with some other entertaining magics that I shan't be discussing with you. Not without a jug of  , that is.   was the shop's first owner many decades ago, and she was an expert in procuring the most scandalous items to be used in fashion and espionage, as well as shipping many orders of more racy things to   in  . Someone told me that the   has a room for amorous encounters named and themed after the Old Mage   himself. Such scandal! I hope this is true, and I should ask for his thoughts on the room soon... Another place of note that I visited was the Windy Road Respite, a new and quite eclectic tavern owned by   that specializes in drinks and endless servings of various smallbites and handfoods, some overly salty to encourage alcohol consumption.\n Lastly, on our way out of town, we stopped at the  , a curious little wall-less tavern on  , where drovers often buy drinks and food while they wait for their wagons or pick-up treats for the road. Despite the place's old history and ramshackle look, its food is superb, notably a large selection of pies, big and small. This  's dish is a larger variant of what they called Drover's Last Pie: a thick and gooey mixture of  , or other fowl, and chopped vegetables, seasoned with dried and fresh herbs and a generous heaping of  . You can ask the turmeric to be replaced with thick   gravy, or it will be ladled atop the pie, also topped with peppered yogurt and some herbed oil. If served hot, you will get a plate or a bowl to catch the dripping filling, but if the pie is chilled, then you can safely eat it on the go without making much of a mess. Most drovers purchase a bag full of various pies of smaller varieties as well as a pack of   tossed in   for later. This recipe will help you make a big golden-crusted chicken pie, filled with herbed gravy, but if you would like to substitute it with mushrooms, the process is almost intuitively easy. Let us begin!\n Shortcrust pie shell\n Makes one pie:\n We have made shortcrust pie shells before and you can easily use another recipe you trust or even buy some from your local baker, so I will be brief this time. Feel free to check other pie dough recipes I've previously shared. Chill butter well and chop it into tiny cubes, using a pastry scraper or a processor, and mix it with flour and salt. Continue cutting the butter into the flour until the granules are the size of small pebbles. Mix the dough together, gradually adding yolks and ice-cold water one spoonful at a time until the mixture comes together smoothly and is valuable but delicate. Keep it chilled as you work, and once done, wrap, seal, and leave it in the cold box to chill for at least an hour.\n Pie filling\n Makes one pie:\n This recipe uses leftover fowl drumsticks, marinated, seasoned, and slowly roasted in yogurt for another recipe. This is the best way of reusing perfectly fine meat, and because we will be using dar meat, the pie will be jam-packed with flavor. All we need to do is shred and pull apart meat into small pieces for about a heaping cup of a cup and a half of beat bits. Remove cartilage, bone, and other unsightly bits from the meat as you pull it apart, and no need to dispose of the skin, rip it, and toss it in with the chicken, especially if the skin is browned \u2013 more flavor! You could also use fresh chicken for the pie, but you will need to season it, toss it in flour, and brown it in a skillet, but already cooked meat is preferable and more traditional for the cooks of Mosstone.\n Prepare the vegetables: peel them, yes, including  , and dice the veggies into more or less uniform pieces. Dice   after cutting off the tough bottoms and set aside, meat and asparagus will go into the filling much later.\n In a soup pot on medium-low heat, melt a spoonful of  , slightly reduce the flames, and toss chopped vegetables in, all except for asparagus. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and black pepper. Take a square of   paper and start folding it until it forms a thin and tall triangle. Measure it to the pot so it is big enough to cover the whole thing, cut it to size, and cut off the very tip. Unfold and use this parchment cover to cover the vegetables, but not before giving them a nice stir. Continue simmering the vegetables, covered with parchment, for ten to fifteen minutes just until they start softening up and release liquids. The cover will ensure some of the moisture is trapped and some is released.\n Now, it is time to remove the parchment and add the liquid ingredients but a quarter cup of water, including a generous spoonful of yogurt. Then, pour in all of the spices and seasonings, including mashed or grated  . The herbs and turmeric will give the filling a greenish tint. Stir and let it all heat up on a medium flame and be brought to a simmer. Once the simmer starts, it will go on for 15 minutes more. While the simmering is going on, whisk together starch and cold water. Make sure that there are no lumps. Now preheat the oven to 425F.\n Pour the starch water into the simmering filling and stir to incorporate. Taste and make sure the seasoning is to your liking; you might need to add a bit more salt. Add the shredded chicken, stir, and simmer until it starts thickening. By now, some of the liquid would've evaporated, making the thickening easier. While the filling is simmering and thickening, work on the crust.\n Split the dough in two and roll it out. One part will be the top, and the other, the bottom. It should be about 1/8th of an inch thick. Line the pie tin with one sheet, making sure it is tightly packed into all the sides and crevices. You can use a bit of dough to press the crust into the tin. Prick the bottom with a fork in several places. Have the top ready, and if you have any dough scraps, make some decorations, like latticework, or use cookie cutters to make some appealing designs.\n If the filling looks nice and thick, turn off the heat and add chopped asparagus. It doesnt need to be cooked; it cooks quickly and will do so in the oven. You should have jsut enough filling to do one deep pie. Pour it into the dough-lined tin. Cover it with the second piece of flat dough and pinch the sides of the bottom layer and the top one together, then roll or fold the pinched layers over eachother to seal the sides. Decorate the top, and do not forget to place some vents; distribute the four open cuts or holes evenly; it will help the pie not to crack open, but even if it does, it is not a big deal.\n Make an eggwash by mixing one   and a drizzle of  . Brush the pie top well with the egg wash. Bake it at 425F on the center oven shelf for 40-45 minutes. Check on the pie 30 minutes in, and if it starts getting too dark, cover it with a sheet of tinfoil. It should be fully done no later than 45 minutes when the crust is golden brown.\n Once the pie is out of the oven, let it cool for at least 20 minutes before unmolding. The ideal tin has a removable bottom, which ensures the pies don't fall apart when removed from the tin. The warmer the pie, the more it will leak out when cut.\n Serve with a bowl of yogurt topped with red pepper flakes and olive oil. A spoonful of that side would mix beautifully with the filling as you eat your slice. A glass of something white and fruity works well with this heavily herbed pie \u2013\u00a0 , a   wine, is a good choice.\n Note that a mushroom gravy variety of the pie exists, but for that, you will need to add two cups of diced mushrooms to the vegetables at the very beginning of the cooking process and substitute chicken stock for mushroom stock or watered-down mushroom gravy. For an additional copper, the cook of Drover's Last Drink would pour a ladle of mushroom gravy on top of your fowl pie slice and toss a handful of chopped   as well.\n And this is all. Somehow, this recipe ended up being more involved than I thought it would be, but the delicious pie is always worth it, especially if it will save you a trip to Tethyr.\n The next recipe will involve spicy   and possibly some seared   testing! And until the next time we cook,  \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Happy fall festivals to you, my friends. I do enjoy the season's foods, feasts, revelries, and cold weather, but we made an autumnal soup last  , and we need to make something else just to keep it interesting. This tenday I am taking you back to my favorite vacation spot in all the  , the   town of  . This beautiful green and shaded walled sanctuary along a dangerous trade route is scenic and hides some of the best meals and mixed quaffs in the entire region. The   brought us a curious stew of   and  . This time, we are going for a light highsunfeast meal of  . 'Tis a handfood you could toss in your bag for the road or get a platter with a side of freshly grilled veggies.\n These tarts do have fanciful names. Some call them upland tarts, others forester's tart, streamside tarts, or even bounty tarts. Their filling varies depending on harvest, foraging, and season. What we will be doing today is   crusts and   filling with wild  's  , tiny sweet cherry  , topped with  . As a side: a simple forest  , grilled until soft and sweet and topped with goat's cheese and balsamic reduction. So, let's begin!\n Dough (makes six handpies):\n This is a tough dough recipe to nail, and I've had a bit of difficulty keeping it cold; make sure to keep an ice box close! Start by preparing ice-cold water. It has to be truly freezing\u2014like you've just gotten it from the  . Then, pour your olive oil (make sure it is NOT extra virgin olive oil, or you will end up with bitter-tasting dough) into a flat container, like a baking dish or a sheet pan. We will place the oil into the icebox to get it hardened. Thinly spread oil will make it much easier to break and portion. I used a bowl and ended up chiseling at it like a down-on-her-luck   sculptor. Sift all the flour into a large bowl. Use a bowl that seems to be too big for the amount of flour you're using. You will thank me later. Add salt and baking powder, and mix. Break and crush the olive oil and transfer it into the bowl. Start mashing it with a fork, working it into the flour. When the oil begins to melt, put the bowl back into the icebox. Continue working it until your flour mix is somewhat like coarse sand with small pebbles of fat. Whisk the   and work it into the flour mix with a fork or with your hands. Add the rest of the wet ingredients to ice-cold water and slowly pour it into the mix while mixing it all together. Keep all parts of the dough cold. Continue working the dough until it is smooth, regularly putting it back into the ice box to keep it chilled.\n Filling:\n Now for the filling. Finely mince both types of olives,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Mix all together into a paste, but reserve some of the chopped thyme for serving. Crumble the goat's cheese. Most of it will go into the tarts, and a bit will be sprinkled atop the grilled leeks later.\n Now, we are going back to the dough. We will have to keep it cold as we work it, regularly returning it to the ice box. Roll the dough about a pinky-finger thickness and cut it into circles and rings, forming a tart shell. Alternatively, you could cut bigger circles and use a bottom of a jar or a mug to pull the dough up and shape it into a cup-like shape. Keep the dough chilled so it retains its shape.\n Grease a baking sheet and assemble the tarts: one heaping spoon of tapenade per shell. Gently press it down, then top it with crumbled cheese, and gently press again. Layer tomatoes on the cheese. Add a light sprinkle of salt and crumble more goat's cheese on to finish them.\n Keep the tarts chilled and pre-heat the oven to 425 F as well as prep and pre-heat your grill. The tarts will go in for about 15\u201320 minutes (keep an eye on them).\n Grilled leeks (3 portions):\n Wash the leaks well between the layers, cut off the root, and chop off the dark green bits. Cut them in half, lengthwise, brush with oil, sprinkle with salt, and place on the hot grill. It takes about 10 minutes per side, depending on the type of grill you're using. Occasionally, press the leeks down to give them nice char marks. When the leeks are cooked on both sides, drizzle them with lemon juice. You can see they are now soft and floppy, as well as more of an olive color, rather than green.\n And finally, plating. A single meal-sized serving is two pies and two slices of leeks per portion. Arrange the foods on the plates, drizzle the leeks with balsamic reduction, sprinkle with crumbled goat's cheese, and sprinkle the entire dish with chiffonaded basil leaves.\n And this is all there is. I suggest serving them with light fruity  , preferably of   making. Please note that the tarts pictured are a bit on the thicker side, and I recommend you keep them thinner.\n And yet another tenday's recipe is done. I've been using a lot of olives lately, it seems... maybe it is time for me to book a caravan to the   again. They have the best olives. Maybe I should ask the Blackstaff for a  . But that is for another tenday's story.\n , my dear friends, and until the next meal.\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Back to the metropolis of   we go. This recipe is from one of the many, many restaurants you can find in the city of  . We rarely visit particularly splendorous eateries, but   of the   district of the Bluff is just that. A lush establishment of rolled-out red carpets, a   cellar that would make King   drool, ornamental ironwork, tapestries that tend to take a new guest's breath way, and, of course, the famous house wine created by the original owner,   himself, back in the day. Today, Gurneth's Goblet is run by Turad's great grand daughter, who stirred the restaurant to be as welcoming and relaxing as it is luxurious. She made sure that people of all wealth levels cound find things on the menu that would be both affordable and delicious. Staples of the old menu for those with   are still there \u2013 smoked   in   sauce,   stews, a selection of  , and of course, what what are making today \u2013  in   paste. The shrimps, or  , depending on the serving size, are marinated, smothered in garlic and ginger mash, and grilled, either on a hot grill grate or wrapped in foil. The dish can be served on a platter of greens as an entre\u00e8, purchased out of a window in the back to take on a road as just a skewer, or topped on a piece of grilled and sauced  , as a sort of handfood. Be warned, my friends, the paste has a strong bite of spice, as I suspect; the dish itself came to the Bluff with merchants from the eastern realms of  ; however, no one at the eatery, not even Claudie Gurneth, knew the background. A mystery for another day!\n Grilled shrimp (makes two servings):\nPaste:\n Shrimp:\n Garnish:\n First, the finer you dice garlic, the more pungent it becomes. Similarly, if you make the paste ahead of time, its garlicky flavor and burn will intensify. It is better to use fresh garlic, as close to being pulled out of the soil as possible. If you are using an actual grill, instead of a grill cast iron pan and wooden skewers, I recommend you soak them in water before grilling. Make a mixture of   flakes or ground red spicy  ,  ,  ,   juice, and  . For the grilling, it is better to use big, fat, fresh shrimp, but prawns are a good substitute. If the fishmonger did not shell and butcher the shrimp for you, all you need to do is pull the shells off and cut the heads. Next, using a sharp knife, make a light incision along the shrimp's back and pull out the black trying that is the shrimp's gut. Once the shrimp is butchered, toss them in the spice mixture we just prepared and evenly cover. Tightly cover and set aside in the cold storage for about thirty minutes, or as long as it will take you to prepare the rest.\n Mash together fresh garlic and fresh ginger with just a bit of  , a dash of salt, and sugar. Using bladed kitchen mashers is a good option if you want to achieve a smooth paste. The paste will be thick but if you notice liquid pooling at the bottom of the bowl, it is too watery. Use a fine cheesecloth, preferably in several layers, to squeeze the liquid out.\n Now, let's quickly prepare the greens: wash and dry them and have them ready to be plated. Pop   and garlic cloves onto the grill or into an oven, wrapped in tin foil, and then roast until they are gooey and soft. Grill two large slices of bread; when crispy, smother one side with roasted tomatoes and garlic and lightly sprinkle with sea salt.\n The shrimp are likely ready by now. Preheat the grill or cast iron grill pan. Skewer three shrimp per stick. If there is too much oil, pat them dry. Plaster the skewers with about two teaspoons of ginger paste and squeeze to press them on. Be warned, even the most well-oiled grill will likely have some paste stuck to it but do not worry, as there is more than enough zing still left on the shrimp after it's done. Alternatively, you can grill them wrapped in tinfoil to achieve more of a steamed effect, but I personally prefer the flavor of crispy browned garlic and ginger. Grilling will be very quick, two minutes per side, and you can start serving. But if you are serving them on a bed of salad, set the shrimp aside and keep warm.\n You should have much of the ginger paste left over. Add a spoonful of oil to a skillet, and fry up the garlic and ginger paste on medium-high heat. It would take about 3-5 minutes. Now chill the mix in the icebox, but do not freeze. Once cooled, add lemon juice and whisk it all together into a makeshift salad dressing.\n Now, all we need to do is plate. We have two options: top the toast with grilled shrimp and consume them as an open-faced sandwich, or serve them on a pile of greens doused in the garlic ginger dressing. Two skewers per portion is enough. A good accompanying drink with the skewers is a chalice of  , a pleasant and fruity   made out of  . But it is a planar beverage. For something more local, or for a pale   or one of the light-elven simmering wines.\n This is all for the tenday. The next stop is  . Until then,  \n Your Friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n And, at last, we can finish the     trilogy this  . The last use of this flavorful lemony   from   is a common staple of countless inns, taverns,  , kitchens, and even temple soup kitchens. The recipe for Heartlands Broth, as I call it, is a combination of elements you might be familiar with after reading this tome for the last two years. The soup is a vegetarian delight made with a variety of vegetables,  , and  , all simmered together to produce a fresh-tasting warm broth of amber. Most kitchens serve just that, topped with slabs of stale   for a couple of  , while others like to add freshly chopped vegetables into a strained broth and load it up with herbs,  , and other fixins. And perhaps the most recent addition to the common Heartlands Broth is a block or couple of spoonfuls of white curds they call  , brought over to the   from the faraway nations of  . Luckily, this bean \"cheese\" travels well and far, especially if packed in liquid or marinades. This mushy tofu is a good source of nourishment for those opposed to or unable to consume meat; ask a  . Yet in  , similar broths are cooked with spices and used to simmer mussels in. Of course, you are free to use chicken stock or chicken broth to make this soup, and it will be just as delicious as what you can buy in the   or  . Also, note that this broth is a bit different from what you can get in the finest eateries of   or  . It is a more rustic type of broth that is cooked over the course of several hours, resulting in a cloudy liquid due to all the vegetables starting to fall apart in the liquid, while fancier broths are cooked quickly and strained to remain as clear as possible, or even clarified using moats of stringy vegetables and eggwhites.\n Amber vegetable stock:\n Makes four servings\n For this recipe, I used pre-made vegetable stock leftover from another recipe to strengthen the flavor by reinforcing it with more vegetables, but as a recipe goes to make broth, most vegetable kitchen scraps can go into the cooking pot.\n Quarter your  , leaving the peel on, slice   and  , roughly chop  , and stick   into the onion. Lightly grease a baking dish and roast the vegetables in a preheated oven at 375F. It should take about twenty-five to thirty minutes for the vegetables to start darkening on the bottom. We want the color and caramelization to get the broth to be amber-colored.\n The next step is to transfer the roasted vegetables into a stock pot, add the rest of the ingredients, cover in broth, stock, or water, bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer, cover, and let it bubble away for two hours. To save you some time, feel free to add all the spices and herbs into a satchel of cheesecloth and tie it up, but the stock will have to be strained later anyway. Add more water if the level drops. We will need to get around three quarts of stock out of it. When done, strain the liquid using a fine sieve; the finer, the better, and discard the spice satchel and vegetable mush.\n Marinated tofu (optional)\n Makes four servings\n Mix all the ingredients until the sugar is dissolved. Gently break the tofu into large pieces and submerge them in the marinade at least an hour ahead; better if submerged overnight. This will give the tofu a bit more flavor, but for blander soup, a simple unflavored tofu spoonful will be enough.\n Heartlands broth\n Makes four servings\n In a soup pot, heat up a spoonful of oil on medium-low flames. Thinly slice  , preferably from the Dalelands, the elongated green kind that has a pleasant crispy crunch, and onion and sweat them in oil to release the flavor. Stir the vegetables regularly to avoid burning. Sprinkle the vegetables with a bit of salt and pepper, stir, and let soften together. Now pour the stock in, bring to a boil, and reduce the flame to a simmer. Cook covered on a gentle simmer for 20 minutes. Try a piece of cabbage; it should be soft now. Start shopping up the peppers, green and red. The peppers are to be diced and added to the simmering soup. Continue cooking covered for another five to ten minutes. Taste the broth and season with salt and pepper. Lastly, clean the enoki   by chopping off the roots and letting them cook with the soup for three more minutes before plating. Enoki mushrooms are a good substitute for certain species of edible mushrooms you might not find elsewhere as expeditions to the    -run mushroom plantations can be perilous and can lend you to become a slave, especially if you try and steal the produce instead of haggling.\n To plate, pick deep bowls. Layer a handful of cooked cabbage on the bottom, and top it with a slab of hin salbread. Smother the bread with a spoonful of red pepper paste or similar pepper sauce if you want a bit of zest. Top the bread with two spoonfuls of silken tofu. Pour the broth around to fill the bowl. Spoon just a bit of the marinade over tofu and top it with some thinly sliced peppers,  , or  . Make sure each bowl has a good amount of mushrooms and peppers in the broth.\n This soup is comfort food, and one can never go wrong with it. Sometime, we will make the Amnian variant, served with seafood, as it is yet another staple that needs to be shared with you, my friends.\n I recommend a good mug of herbal tea from   to go with the vegetable theme or a chalice of spiced green wine, the drow, or the grape variety.\n This is all for the tenday.  , friends, and have a great year!\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Happy eveningfeast, my friends! It is my favorite time of the day, as well as all other meal times, and despite my feeling sick with some unknowable  , we are going to make something simple this  . There is nothing cheaper and heartier than a simple meal from a Dalesmen inn.\n This dish, or should I say, this meal consisting of two foods, comes from the man called  , the portly cook from   in  . Despite the food's simplicity, Korvan once cooked for the grand and splendorous   in  . He also looks down on customers asking for one too many samples of the inn's  . Be warned, dear traveling friends.\n    sound like a simple peasant meal, and believe me, it is. Locally grown carrots tend to be large, thick, and woody and are left late into the autumn in the ground, but younger plants produce sweet and crunchy roots. There is little need to make them tastier, so Korvan chops them up, slowly cooks them in butter until soft and creamy, tosses them in melted butter and  , and serves as a whole meal. Another item on his menu is large local  , stuffed with cheese and other fixins. These mushrooms are baked and serve one large per serving or two small ones.\n Buttered Carrots:\n For Serving:\n First of all \u2013 leave sugar off if you're using young and sweet carrots; only use it if the carrots you have and big old woody things, like good old  . If you want to be simple and quick, slice carrots into finger-length pieces of somewhat uniform size. Cutting a single stem in 4 is a good example here. If you want to be fancy, you can get those expensive tiny carrots that come shaved into oblong shapes. Or if you have time and finesse, you could shape your carrots into cocotte shapes, but that just produces too much waste for my tastes.\n Drizzle the oil into a saucepan, add carrots, butter, a bit of water, or stock, two   cloves worth of mash,  ,  . Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 30 minutes. About 25 minutes in, test the carrots with a cake tester of a knife; they should be soft but not fall apart. Cook uncovered for 5 minutes. You could finish the carrots by adding more sugar and glazing them, but for a regular version of the dish, take the carrots out and toss them with fresh melted butter and chopped herbs. Taste: if the flavor is fine, set aside and keep warm.\n Cheese-Filled Mushrooms:\n Optional: one egg, red pepper flakes, and paprika. Swiss or provolone cheese for topping.\n We will begin by gently scooping out the stems and membranes from the inner sides of the mushrooms. Use a thin or sharp-edged spoon to make it easier; try not to break or damage the caps. Reserve the scooped parts. Brush the outside of the mushrooms' cups with butter and place them in a greased baking dish (to avoid them sticking). Chop onion finely, and with a bit of butter, let it cook on a skillet until softened and sweet. Chop mushroom bits and do the same; cook them until darkened and cooked. Now  : place spinach and butter, sprinkled with pepper and a bit of butter, and cook for 4 minutes until it reduces in size and wilts. Let it cool, and with your hands, squeeze the spinach to remove excess water. Slice red peppers, scoop out their seeds, and bake them on a sheet pan at 400F and bake for 20 minutes. Let them cool, dice, and dab them with paper towels to remove excess water.\n Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix into stuffing. If you think your mix is too dry - add a single  . Do not overwork the mix, or the stuffing will be tough, rubbery. Spoon the stuffing into the mushrooms. There should be exactly enough stuffing for four big mushrooms. Brush the stuffing's top with melted butter and decorate with some cheese for an appealing crust. Bake on 375F for about 25 minutes.\n The plating is easy. A single mushroom at the plate's center and a handful of carrots around it. The mushrooms can be mashed and eaten with mushrooms or separately. And this dish needs a nice tankard full of cold   exported out of  .\n This is all I have for you this tenday. Eat, grow strong, grow wide, and I will try and beat this disease   sent my way. Next time \u2013 an   dish of sweet fall  !\n  and until the next hero's feast.\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met or welcome back, my friends. This  's recipe is going to be something different. We've made dumplings before \u2013 a dish served in  , but now it's time to go to a completely different continent to look for something new.   \u2013 an eastern island nation of  . Well, not really. We are not going to go there. Instead, I can offer you a trip to the city of   on the  , across the lake from  . Westgate had a hefty population of immigrants from the nations of Kara-Tur that arrived there just a generation and a half ago. With them came many new ingredients, foods, and traditions. This recipe does not come from an eatery, an inn, or a tavern. It comes from a   servant girl who once worked for   of the prominent merchant   clan from Westgate.\n Dallia was not a nice person. She was ruthless and cruel to her enemies, and her raging hatred was aimed at at least one prominent Kara-Turan immigrant \u2013  . Despite that, Dallia often asked her kitchen staff to make this version, a Westgate interpretation, if you will, of Kozakuran dumplings. Historically, the Kozakuran diet protein had been mainly seafood. This recipe is indeed seafood dumplings made with   or   meat. We will make a bunch, use some with a bowl of nice herbed broth, and store the rest in an icebox to cook later. As far as I know, the main difference is dumplings in Westgate are made with    , while Kozakuran prefer   flour or  .\n While seafood is the traditional filling for these dumplings, we can also use lamb. Lamb is a bit of an exotic type of meat on the islands, but it is common in certain continental areas. Lamb from Ching Tung and Ma' Yuan eventually made their way to Kozakura to be used as dumpling filling. As far as I can tell, it is still rare, but lamb dumplings similar to those are common here in Westgate. To make lamb dumplings, simply double the dough recipe and use it for lamb. I will separate lamb dumplings into a separate recipe to be published next and add a variation of stew that is topped with these dumplings.\n Spiced carrot side salad (4 servings):\nPickling:\n Salad:\n This part is simply a side dish. You can skip it altogether, but I like having a bit of a salad to go with a dish, be it a morningfeast or a last bite. Picking   needs to be done well in advance. One or two days would be enough, even though I made mine half a day ahead. Thinly julienne carrots and   into ribbons about a finger's length. Mix all the liquids and spices together in a pot, add sliced carrots and onions, bring the liquid to a boil, and let simmer for a few minutes. Take off the heat, cover, and let cool down. Set aside to pickle and marinade. When you are ready to make the salad, we will drain the pickling liquid as well as we can before adding in  .\n Assemble the salad just before dinner and serve it first as an appetizer. Add carrots to a salad bowl, roughly chop rehydrated or fresh seaweed. Make sure it is drained as well. Grate or press   into pulp. Now, all you need to do is add oil, spices, and seasonings and stir everything together. If you want the salad to be sweeter, a tiny spoon of sugar or two is an option.\n Dough (makes 14 dumplings):\n To make the dough, start by mixing the flour and salt in a bowl. Then, pour the boiling water into the flour mixture and stir it with a spatula or a spoon. At first, the mixture may resemble dry sand, but don't worry. Keep stirring until all the ingredients come together into a tough dough. Wrap it up and let it chill in cold storage to relax the gluten for at least forty minutes.\n Filling (makes 14 dumplings):\n Let us begin by mincing   or   meat. Now add  , fish and oyster sauce, minced  , white  , ground  , and  . Mix together well, cover, and leave in cold storage to marinade for 30 minutes. Do not discard shrimp or lobster shells. We will use them in broth. Once the marinading is done, add a single  's eggwhite to the bowl and combine it all thoroughly once again. Something I did not do myself, but I recommend you: use an artificer's mashing device to turn the meat mix into a paste, or at least chop the shrimp very finely, more so than shown in the illustrations.\n Break the chilled dough into 14 even pieces. Roll each one thinly, at least 6  of an inch. Place a spoonful of filling at the center of the dough circle, pull all the sides up, and pinch sealed, twisting the top. These dumplings can be frozen for future use. But we will steam them. Place dumplings in a boiling steamer on a sheet of parchment paper, cover, and steam for up to eight minutes.\n Broth (makes 4 servings):\n As always, making broth is a great way to use up scraps. In addition to the usual shells,  ,  , onion, garlic,  , pepper, ginger, and herbs, I used garlic and onion skins and vegetable shavings. Shellfish and anise will give us a slightly sweet stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for thirty minutes. Strain the broth.\n Now, all we need is to plate. You can serve steamed dumplings on your own or drown in the broth. Shop up greens, about a heating tablespoon per bowl: parsley, chives, scallions, and arugula sprouts to give it a nice bitter zest. Taste and make sure the seasoning is to your liking.\n And this is all. A hearty meal of spicy pickled carrot salad, followed by a herbed bowl of broth with dumplings. All that is missing now is a nice tankard of light  .\n Next time, we will talk about lamb dumplings and a dumpling stew from the  . Until then,  .\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n And another  's gone by, and I am late once again. This time, however, due to a cooking accident that involved a bottle of flammable liquor, hot sauce, and a careless application of a  . But enough about kitchen misfortunes. During my last visit to the City of Coin,  , I found an eatery that served  , oblong meatballs on a stick, and several types of sauced meatball dishes, all from different parts of the continent. After some snooping around, I found recipes of sweet  -style lamb meatballs,   baked breakfast meatballs with a spiced   sauce, a dollop of  's    , and a baked egg. Lastly, I found a recipe for the so-called   they grill in lawless  . Making all three is a lot of work, but the meatball mix is fairly similar for each of the recipes. So let's begin.\n We will start with two sauces, which need at least an hour of cooking before being used. For the Chessentan tomato sauce, you will need peeled tomatoes, fresh or preserved, one forth head of sweet  , sea salt,  , three roughly chopped cloves of  , a heaping spoon of   and a heaping spoon of freshly ground   (the more, the better). Add your canned peeled tomatoes or three-four sweet fresh tomatoes in a saucepan and squeeze them with your hands to roughly mash them. Imagining a naughty past paramour helps. If your fresh tomatoes are too hard, use a potato masher or squeeze them with a bottom of a tankard. You want the mash to be chunky. I do not know why, but it just creates a batter texture. Add the rest of the ingredients and cook on medium-low flames for at least an hour. About halfway through cooking, stir well and taste. You may want to adjust the spices and salt to taste. I added a dash of hot pepper and a dash of   zest to the sauce. Cook covered, but if your sauce is too soupy, evaporate the liquid before serving.\n For the Luiren sweet and spicy sauce, we traditionally use  , but   are not in season, so we will return to it later. We are going to make a sweet  -based sauce loosely inspired by Harelveauplum. We will need a healthy squeeze of honey. For this recipe, I can recommend you the honey from   as its complexity of flavor compliments the sauce. Add honey into another saucepan along with a single chopped  , a spoonful of coriander, a spoon of salt, ground pepper, a drizzle of  , a handful of   condiment, and a bit of lemon juice for taste. Cook it all together on low flame until the shallots are soft and translucent. It should take a bit over an hour. Halfway through, add half a mug of hot sweet sauce \u2013 Harelveauplum, if you have it. If not \u2013 sweet and spicy pepper condiment should do. Mix well and continue simmering covered.\n While your sauces and bubbling away like an angry tavern cook, prepare your lamb meat. You could ground your own using lamb shoulder or use pre-ground meat from your butcher. Just remember to get fattier mince, or your balls will be tough. We will make two mixed. Number one will be for meatballs, and number two \u2013 for Lambtails. First bowl: mix together well a pound of lamb mince, a cup of bread crumbs (I used sweet eggy   made by   of Amn), half a spoon of rough salt, the same amount of pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. When it's well incorporated, roll the meat into balls of the size you prefer, depending on the size of your cookware and plates. You can quickly brown the balls and put them away. You don't need to cook them thoroughly, and you will have more than enough for two dishes.\n The second meat bowl will be the same as before, but you will also add a single   and a small spoon of  . This batch will be shaped into Lambtails on small wooden skewers and grilled on a red hot pre-heated grill or skillet. Three minutes on each side and grill marks are all you need. And while you're grilling meat, why don't you toss some vegetables to cook alongside? I grilled some small peppers and cherry tomatoes on a stalk.\n As you grill, assemble the Chessentan dish. Place four meatballs in an over-safe ramekin. Top with your tomato sauce. Shake well so the sauce fills the bowl well, then add a spoonful of sheep's yogurt on one side. Place in a pre-heated oven and cook for 10 minutes to heat up the sauce and cook the meatballs through. Take out, crack an egg onto the side opposite of yogurt, add a grilled pepper, and sprinkle the top with some strong aged cheese. Bake for another ten minutes. While the meatballs are baking, toss a handful of meatballs into your sweet Luiren-style sauce, roll them in it, and cook for about 10 minutes on low heat.\n Plating time. The Chessentan lamb meatballs are ready to be served. All you need is to decorate it with ribbons of fresh mint leaves. Luiren-style lamb meatballs are to be placed on a small plate, topped with the sweet sauce, and sprinkled with more hard aged cheese. Lastly, Lambtails can be piled on a plate and served with grilled vegetables. I added roasted     with almonds and lemon and a dollop of yogurt.\nEnough food to feed three hungry adventurers. Serve it with a bottle of nice red   and freshly baked bread.\nThis was quite an evening, preparing all of these dishes. Of course, you could make most parts of these dishes ahead of time and then simply warm them all up and plate.\n This halfling needs a tankard of   and a nap.\nUntil next time,  , and good night.\nJuniper Churlgo\n \n \n And another  's here. The recipe I bring you today is from a place I rarely get to venture into: the  , a big archipelago west of the  . The dish in question is a classic from the history books. It was a favorite comfort food of  , the High King of  \u2014a simple mix of savory  ,  , and   in  . The origins of the dish are somewhat obfuscated by the number of variants there are. The most notable theory is that the dish comes from the  , the   of   and  . The elvish version is served as a stir fry of large meaty and very savory mushrooms and lettuce, drizzled with herbal sauce and a generous handful of chopped chives. The variant adopted by the Isles'   is made with rice that is simmered in stock and mushrooms with a drizzle sauce of   and   with a bit of sweetness and spices. Other variants are made with fried mushrooms and little pearls of toasted dough, also called couscous. In many eateries, especially in the human settlements where the   name is still revered, these bowls of rice are actually named after the old High King, or at least the menus mention his name. In Corwell, it is traditional to stir a couple of egg yolks into the cooked dish to add a bit of extra flavor to the bowl.\n Moonshae rice bowl\n Makes two servings:\n First thing first, measure out the rice. It expands, so a single cup of rice is enough for two portions. And going from that, the recipe scales up perfectly. I am using jasmine rice, but this will work with any type as long as you follow the rice cooking instructions on the packaging. You need to wash the rice thoroughly, several times until the water runs clear. To speed up the cooking, you can soak the rice in water for 30 minutes or so, but it is not necessary.\n Prepare and measure the rest of the ingredients. Finely dice a small  , and coarsely dice the mushrooms. Save two royal trumpet mushrooms and slice them in half. Score the cut side in the light lattice of cuts.\n Add oil to a pot and slowly cook the shallots in it. After about 8 minutes of cooking on no flame, add chopped mushrooms and cook on medium flame, occasionally stirring the mushrooms in the oil. In about five minutes, the shallots would begin changing colors from translucent to golden. We do not want the mushrooms too browned.\n Add drained   and stock. Measure out the seasonings:  ,  ,  , and  . Be careful not to oversalt the rice, as the sauce we will drizzle it with will be salty. Cover and let the rice simmer. For jasmine rice, it takes 18-20 minutes to simmer.\n While the rice is simmering, prepare a sauce of   sauce,  ,  , and  . Miz them in a small saucepan or a skillet and bring them up to a boil. Let it reduce just a little bit, then place the sliced and scored royal trumpet slice-side down and cook on high heat for several minutes. Check the bottom for browning and flip over. Cook for several minutes more. Remove from heat and drain. Save the sauce to sprinkle on the rice later.\n 'I like using baby lettuce for this dish because of the leaves and their adorable crunchiness. Feel free to double the amount you add! When the cooking time is up, check on your rice and make sure it's not overcooked or stuck to the bottom. It should be sticky but not thick. Taste the rice for doneness and seasoning. Stir in two tankards of loosely packed baby green leaf lettuce whole. Let it go wild and cook just a bit for 3-4 minutes in the rice. Once the lettuce looks wilted but still has its bite, turn off the heat and pour in chopped chives, stir it all in, and serve immediately.\n Pile two spoonfuls on a plate and top with cooked and browned king oyster or royal trumpet mushrooms, sprinkle with green onions, and drizzle some of the mushroom sauce over rice. Make sure the rice is not already salty; otherwise, you will ruin the plate.\n Alternative presentations can be some cooked or grilled   or   and topped with a hefty fixed vegetable pattie. I recommend a tankard of hard apple   to go with the dish, something local to the Moonshaes or  .\n This is all for the tenday. Next time, we will fry some   street food and   some mushrooms  -style.\n Until the next time we cook,   friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, friends, and welcome back to the Forest Kingdom of   and its capital,  . The establishment we are going to talk about today is very near Suzail's northwestern walls. If you enter the city through the  , which opens into the   on one side and the grand   of Suzail on the other, you need to turn right just as you enter the city. This is  ; follow it until it reaches a moot, and on the right side, you will see  . By reputation, this establishment is naught but a seedy low-  brothel that has been declining in popularity in the late 15  century  . We all know that one aging gentleman who claims to enjoy a festhall with skimpily-clad dancers just because it serves the best hot-fried   or carries the best libations from the marshlands of Cormyr. In the Willing Smile's case, it actually may be true. The establishment can be boldly put in master  's travel guide for the Smile's food, cleanliness, and service. By  , the brothel is naught but a miniature   that offers clean rooms, a tidy taproom, a quiet atmosphere, privacy, and the attention of the brothel's matronly \"Mother\" Maraedra. The aging woman still bears the attractiveness that is slowly being eroded by time, and her goodly nature can be attested by her friendship with the Old Mage  , who had to receive another token mention in my column. If you ever are Maraedra's guest, ask for the quiet but lavishly decorated backroom that resembles a noble's private parlor rather than a business, where you can enjoy a nice meal and a dancer or a songstress if you choose such company for the evening.\n The typical dish that Mother would likely serve you is her Herbed Paste, the woman's own spin on a traditional Cormyte-Dalesfolk recipe. She serves bowls of such spreads with diced    , buns or   of the day, and seemingly endless pitchers of undiluted young   or  , if Mother wanted to poke fun at Elminster were he at the table with you. The said Herbed Paste consists of various local vegetables roasted with oil and cooked until the entire batch browns and can be mashed into a decadent spread. A generous handful of seasonings and fresh herbs was then folded into the paste to be smothered on biscuits of bread and topped with berry-crusted goat's cheese. A quality Herbed Paste will take time, so let us begin now.\n Herbed Paste\n Makes four generous servings:\n The first step will be very passive: Preheat the oven to 400F, and while it is getting hot and ready, turn on the burner and char the   s by putting them directly into the flames, turning until they blacken and blister on all sides. This would take about 8 minutes in total. Once you're satisfied with blackening, place the peppers in sealed bags and let them steam up. You can leave them at room temperature or toss them into the cool storage until the baking is done.\n Now, the oven should be hot enough. Roughly chop   (or sweet  ),  , yellow  , large  , and  . Sprinkle them with some   and   and toss in  . Transfer to a sheet pan. Slice   lengthwise in two and drizzle with oil, salt, and pepper. Peel the   cloves, toss them in oil, and wrap them in tin foil. Add to the pan. Bake the vegetables for 15 minutes. Check on the vegetables and make sure the leeks are not burning. Give it another ten minutes and turn the vegetables over on the sheet pan. You might want to remove the leeks now. Bake for another 10-15 minutes to develop caramelization. Regularly check on the vegetables and remove them if they get too dark.\n The next step is to transfer all the vegetables you just cooked into a deep pan big enough to hold them all. The pan needs to have a fitting cover. Mince the cooked vegetables if you want to make the cooking faster. Using a spoon, scoop softened flesh from the eggplant skin and add it to the pan drizzled with a bit more of the oil. Add the rest of the cooked vegetables. Time to take the peppers out of the bags. Now, they should be soft and wet. Using a napkin, rub the charred skin off, remove the cores, and dice the flesh. Add it to the pan. Sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper (you can adjust the seasoning in a later step) and add a generous sprinkle of   seeds. If you have trouble finding it, consider replacing it with   or  . You may use sweet   to give it a more Sembian flavor, but it is an optional addition. Cover the pan with a lid and let the vegetables slowly simmer on medium-low heat. This will take a long while, so keep your eye on the pan. We will return to it once the vegetables release all the moisture.\n Now, let us deglaze the baking sheet with some hot vegetable or     to which you can add 1/4 cup of white wine for flavor. Scrape the fond. Ignore the sheet pan if you accidentally blackened and charred all the vegetable juices. Pour the deglazing liquid into the vegetables. About 30 minutes into the cooking, open the lid and stir the vegetables to ensure all layers release the juices. Cover and cook, simmering for 20 mins more. By now, the vegetables should be swimming in their own juices. Remove the lid and mash them with a potato masher or a wooden spatula. If the vegetables feel too tough, mash, stir, and cover to cook a little bit more. But to finish the dish, we need to remove all the liquid and turn the vegetables into a mash. Continue simmering, but leave the vegetables uncovered. When the liquid is almost all gone, taste and season with salt and pepper. Stir taste again and add   and   juice. Stir and simmer for a few minutes more. And now is the last moment to taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.\n We will serve the Herb Paste after it cools just a bit. We will spoon fresh chopped herbs into the mash before bringing it to the table. A side dish with the meal will be an   green leek soup \u2013 a derivative of the   soup, but made for the   Cormyte tastes. And to the table, we will bring diced goat's cheese caked in sweet cranberries, fresh buns, and a handful of nuts. Now, to the soup.\n Green Elfin Leek Soup\n Makes four servings\n Dumplings:\n This soup is one of the possible ways of using up those unsightly dark green parts of leeks. We will use one large leek's dark leaves leftover from the previous recipe for Herbed Paste and in addition to it, one full small leek, light and dark leaves. We should end up with about two cups of thinly sliced leeks, tightly packed. Use only flush and succulent greens; cut off and throw away any leaves that are dry or drying out. Slice the leaves into thin ribbons. Finely chop or grate garlic.\n Melt   in a large skillet, and on medium-low flames, start sauteeing the leeks. Cook them slowly, tossing them around the pan regularly. We want the leeks to soften and develop flavor. The green parts of leeks have tough fibers and a more aggressive flavor than the leek whites. The sauteeing would take about 6-10 minutes until they soften. Next, add cloves, salt, pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and a small dollop of  . Toss them around the pan and transfer them into a soup pot.\n Add chicken stock to the pot and simmer for 10 more minutes. While the soup is simmering, mix together all of the ingredients indicated above to make a dumpling batter. Bring the soup to a rolling boil to make sure the liquid is very hot, reduce it to a simmer, and spool the batter into the soup. Space the spoonfuls so they do not clump. You will likely have more batter than enough, but I love dumplings and cook some extra to add to the soup as I eat it. Cover the soup and continue simmering the dumplings until they float up and plump up, and harden. You can't really overcook them, so simmer away as you prepare the dinner. In 5-6 minutes, check the dumplings, pierce them with a fork, and check if they have resistance and are holding together. Either serve the soup with four dumplings per serving or boil up more to serve on the table for guests to add to the soup later. They are especially good with a dollop of butter.\n And just like that, the dinner is ready. Serve four small bowls of Herbed Paste; do not forget to stir fresh herbs into it. Pour the soup with four dumplings. Add a bowl of soft butter cubes to smother on the bread or add to the dumplings. And, of course, buns, crackers, and sweet cranberry goat's cheese. Bring a pitcher of ice-cold  , and we are ready to eat!\n Next time we will record the recipe for some   dumplings from   and will try and replicate a certain past-it hand pie from Waterdeep. But until then,  \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n It has been a   since we last talked about foods. Good tidings, friends, and today we will travel far because the recipe we are covering is common and is eaten in  , the  , the  , the  ,  , and even in the Outer Planes!\n The culprit is nutbread...   made with milled nuts if you can imagine such a thing. Bread with no gluten. To be honest, this type of baking is alien to me, and I had to try out several formulae to nail the taste and texture as what I've tried on my travels. I am going to make three dishes for you. First of all, regular nutbread, nothing fanciful or exotic in its flavoring, as what you can buy in Cormyr or the Dales. I am serving it drowned in   with some   and teeny weeny picked  . This bread is served like that in   and  . The second type of nutbread will be from the plane of   and made with warm spices and carrots, mildly sweet to taste. And lastly, as it is customary in Turmish, I'll make a bowl of simple onion and chive soup.\n My first attempt at making the bread resulted in a hard and coarse nightmare. I used a mix of   and   flour,  , and pumpernickel flour. It was a failure. I decided to substitute the rough flour for   flour or coconut milk powder. And this was exactly what I needed, and it gave the bread a gentle taste of my beloved   (remind me to fry some Luiren bananas for you one day!) So let's begin!\n Cormyrean nutbread:\n For regular, Cormyrean nutbread, we will use a mug of almond and walnut flour, a mug of powdered coconut milk, a healthy squeeze of   or, in my case,  , a  's eggs, a dash of  , a dash of  , and a generous pinch of soda. Now we need to act fast. Mix all dry ingredients together (leave soda out for now), mix liquid ingredients together and add them into a single bowl. Now put in your soda and add a teaspoon of lemon juice or any other acid. Quickly mix the dough. It will be wet and sticky. We have to bake the mix immediately to ensure the soda is still active and fluffs up an otherwise dense loaf. There is no gluten, so there is absolutely no need to rest your mix. Butter or grease your molds and bake for thirty-eight minutes.\n Bytopian carrot nutbread:\n For Bytopian carrot nutbread, the recipe will remain largely the same. But we will need to make two well-packed mugs of shredded  . Bytopian produce is famous for being the sweetest and the most delicious in the entire multiverse, but if you live in the  , you might have to use local tough and less sweet roots. Shred your carrots, put a handful of brown sugar for taste and a handful of regular sugar into the carrots and mix well to coat evenly. Cover and put away. Sugar will sap out carrot juice, and we will need to use it for flavor. To make the tough, we'll use honey, two eggs, a heaping of sliced almonds, a generous handful of charnushka, and ajwain seeds. Follow the same instructions as before and treat carrots and carrot sugar juice as a liquid ingredient. Mix well to make sure the seeds are equally spread through the dough. Drop some liquid butter on top of the bread and bake. Expect it to take longer, and it will be ready when a tester comes out clean.\n Turmishian onion and chive soup:\n Now soup \u2013 an easy task. Turmishian onion and chive soup is something I call four onions soup. Chop up yellow onions, leeks, red onions, and spring onions and put them with a bit of butter, cooking on low flame until it's all soft and sweet. Now add a tankard of dry white  , pump up the heat, and reduce until it's down to ten percent of the original liquid. Chop up some herbs; I used just parsley and thyme and a generous amount of chives. Add salt, pepper,   if you like the taste and several tankards of stock or water. Cook until the soup is whiteish, and serve.\n As I had leftover nutbread dough, I decided to add some wheat flour to it and roll it out in thin stripes. Onto the stripes, I spooned some finely chopped and slowly cooked mushrooms and onions, topped with leftover almonds and cheese. Roll them up, sit them in your greased baking mold onto wetted disks of dough and bake for roughly the same amount of time as Cormyrean nutbread.\n Now we are ready to plate, and this time it's simple and rustic. Bytopian nutbread is served in thick slices and drizzled with molasses. Cormyrean nutbread is broken in two and ladled with thick savory gravy of fowl, cow, or mushroom. I don't need to tell you how to make gravy. On the side, add some cornichons and pickled pearl onions and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Lastly, your soup should be hot. Sprinkle it with fresh herbs for color and add a drizzle of herby   or  .\n This research and trial and error method absolutely exhausted me, but the result was good and bears some semblance to the original dishes, so I am satisfied. Let me know if you've ever made something with nutbread, and if you did, what version did you cobble up?\n In any event, I've rambled long enough, my friends. For the next dish, we will go further north and do something quick and easy. How does   sound?   can have its gastronomical surprises!\n  and until next time,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n \"  on the warpath\" is how many describe the small city-state, one of the three that ruled the  . This little saying is relevant to the dish I bring you this  . The Shining Plains cities are not much different from the rest of the Vilhon Reach \u2013 the region of petty wars, plagues, and political tumult. Ormath itself is an aggressive neighbor that started petty wars over grazing rights for their horses. \u00a0But due to its location on  , which the city protects, the trade is booming. It became a caravan stop for those traveling into  . The dish on today's agenda is Ormathyn Stewed  , and its history began more than a thousand years ago \u2013 it is almost as old as Ormath itself. Initially, a simpler version of the stew was made with meat scraps and fed to the raiders, soldiers, militia, and cavalry of the city, as potatoes were and still are quite cheap in the Shining Plains. The stew stayed popular even beyond the times of strife, war, and rationing. Today, Ormathyn Stewed Potatoes are prepared with   or   stock, sometimes using game. Starchy potatoes are also now well-seasoned with sweet spices or a specifically made local mix of  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Still, the   and vegetables used tend to differ from kitchen to kitchen. This recipe is my own version of the stew served to me at the   as they did not want to disclose the exact steps and measurements used in the dish. Notably, I've heard of some cooks finishing the stew with goat's milk or cow's cream and some smoky cheese, but I will leave that to you to experiment with. A typical Ormathyn inn meal consisted of a full bowl of stewed potatoes, roasted or stewed meat, grilled or boiled tubers, root vegetables,  , and fruit, dusted with   and powdered berries.\n Pre-cooked potatoes & broth:\n Makes two servings\n Begin by washing and peeling the potatoes. For this stew, you want to pick starchy or universal potatoes, as the natural starches will help thicken the concoction. Cut the potatoes into 1.5-2-inch pieces and toss them into a big soup pot. Wash and roughly chop  ,  , and  , and add into the same pot. Make a satchel of spices using butcher's twine and  . Put  , sliced fresh  , a piece of   bush,  ,  , and a piece of hot dried red pepper, smoky variety preferably. Tie the satchel tight and add into the pot. Cover the vegetables with four cups of beef stock and add water if needed to cover.\n Turn the heat up, bring to a boil, and cook for twenty or twenty-five minutes. We want to cook the potatoes partially so they start to become soft on the edges, and if pierced, they still have a bit of resistance. Once you pierce the potato and test for the doneness, use a strainer and pour the broth out into a big bowl. Feel free to throw away celery, carrots, and onions, but reserve the potatoes and spice satchel. Transfer the partially cooked potatoes into another bowl and cover to keep them from drying off. Wipe the soup pot; we will use it again shortly. Pour the potato broth into a smaller sauce pot, return the spice satchel into the liquid, turn up the heat, and let it boil and reduce by at least 1/3 of the original volume.\n Stewed potatoes\n Makes two servings:\n Balti seasoning mix:\n While the broth is reducing, let us prepare the unsalted  ,  , and onion. Using a fine grater, grate the onion into mush straight into the soup pot; do not discard the juice. Add five spoonfuls of butter and turn the heat to low. Cook the onion in butter as it melts, giving it a light browning. It should take about eight to ten minutes. Next, pour in the spices and finely minced   into the onion and butter, but keep the chives on the side till a bit later. Stir the mix and let the spices cook for a few minutes in hot butter.\n Sprinkle the flour into the butter, stir once again, and cook for a couple of minutes more to remove the raw flavor. Now add the broth, which should've reduced enough on another stove burner. Whisk to dissolve the flour and butter. Add potatoes and chives. Using a large spoon, stir the stew, and do not be afraid to be gentle; we want the potato edges to beak off, release starch, and look rough to help them be coated in the stew. Taste and make sure the seasoning is to your liking. Cover and cook for ten to fifteen minutes more or until the potatoes are fully cooked.\n For those who like a stew with more creaminess and cheese, both can be added with a handful of fresh herbs. If you do, make sure the cheese is fully melted into the stew before stirring in the herbs.\n For garnish, all you need is sliced spring onions and some fried garlic crunch. And a mug of sweet red  . However, wheat   from the Shining Plains would be a most traditional pairing, as well as some crispy, deep-fried, and salted veggies.\n And another tenday's recipe is in the books.  , my friends, until next time.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  , I bring you a story of shame, failure, and perseverance. This hin was under the weather and decided to make something quick and easy, so I settled on   I once saw made in  . I once read in a highly reputable publication penned by none other than   that ruth-balls and variations on the recipe are made in  ,  , and lovely  , and in Waterdeep they are dipped in a warming spicy concoction they call  . My first attempt to shape these balls was a mushy disaster of   and oil soup. My second attempt produced uniform morsels that held together well, but the mix ended up being too finely ground. But any disaster is a learning experience, and I can tell you exactly what I did wrong and what to look out for. So, my friends, let us begin.\n Ruth-balls\n Makes 14 morsels:\n We will make a handful of fried ruth-balls, with the Turmish cream sauce on the side, served with red   flatbreads and grilled   salad. For ruth-balls, you will need a tankardfull of chickpeas, two cloves of  , one  , a large handful of  , and another one of  , a bit of   juice, a spoon of tahini sauce, and generous amounts of crushed red    ,  ,  ,  , and black pepper. Now heed my wisdom. Use dried chickpeas, not preserved ones. Soak them in cold water overnight and thoroughly drain before cooking. Roughly chop your herbs and onion, and add all of them together to be finely minced or processed using a   or two. Be careful not to turn it into a paste. We are looking into the consistency of very coarse sand. Taste, adjust seasoning, add two heaping spoons of flour, and mix well. We need some flour to keep the balls together, but too much, and you're making buns instead. Traditionally, ruth-balls are just that, balls pressed together and fried in hot fat. If you are low on  , press your balls into a patty and pan-fry them until brown. You could also bake them, but that won't give you a crispy, crunchy shell.\n Turmish cream sauce\n Makes two servings:\n Now, let's prepare the sauce. Finely chop half an onion and a handful of mushrooms and cook them in butter until they are brown and golden. Soft vegetables will release flavor and will be easy to mill. Add minced or pureed garlic, and two cloves are enough, a squeeze of   paste, dried herbs (thyme, parsley, and sage), a generous amount of  , and a spoon of hot red pepper or mashed and preserved pepper paste. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring for a couple of minutes. Reduce heat to the lowest and add a quarter tankard of milk and a quarter tankard of cream. If you wish for a more savory flavor, add a quarter tankard of chicken stock. Whisk it all together and cook to marry the flavors. Make sure to keep the heat the same, or your cream will break. After five minutes of simmering the sauce (without stock), take it off the heat and push it through a fine sieve. If you are using chicken stock, gently simmer it until it is thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Your sauce will need to be pushed through, which will turn the mushrooms and onion into the sauce's thickener. Keep warm and serve on the side. If you notice it has become too thick, water it down just a touch with stock.\n Chickpea mash\n Makes two small servings:\n If you have any extra chickpeas, another side will be chickpea mash. Simply mash chickpeas, a large spoonful of tahini,  , garlic, and lemon juice together. Season with spices, salt, and pepper, and mix in a few tablespoons of water until it's a smooth paste. You can flavor it more with doubling pepper, paprika, and cumin. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and some chopped herbs.\n Red lentil flatbreads\n Makes four small breads:\n The last part is easy, too. Soak one tankard of dried red lentils in two cups of cold water for several hours or overnight. Mash them together with the water until they form a gloopy paste. Add salt and pepper and mix well. Now pan fry the batter with just a bit of butter for color. Take a small ladle, pour a portion of the batter into the pan, and quickly distribute it to be a thin cr\u00eape. When you see bubbles forming on the top, flip the flatbreads and cook until it stiffens; it usually takes just a couple of minutes. Roll them up and serve on the side for dipping.\n Lastly, grilled cabbage salad. Preheat your grill or griddle. Slice your cabbage into wedges or thick steaks. Lightly brush the surface with olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper. Drop onto the grill and press down. When you see cabbage leaves gaining a lighter yellow tint, flip and press again. Plate with picked  , cherry tomatoes, and some salty crumbly  . You will not need dressing for the cabbage, but if you would like \u2013 use a simple mix of olive oil and lemon juice.\n The biggest challenge of the recipe is getting the ruth-ball mixture right. Yours truly failed twice before succeeding, so learn from my failures. These foods together can be found in the cosmopolitan cauldron that is Waterdeep. You can put a single ball on the flatbread, top it with the sauce, the mash, and a leaf of grilled cabbage, and enjoy!\n I promise you that the next recipe will be in better shape and won't be a failure. We are going just next door to the  .\n That would be all for today, my dear friends.\n  and until the next tenday.\n Yours truly, \nJuniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  , we return to the coastal city of  , perched right atop the forehead of the  .   food is not known for its complexity, but what it's known for is its fresh seafood, something that is just so hard to find for a reasonable   where I am. Today's recipe is Sixroots Salad from  , and it is cooked with boiled  . Also, an important note: it is not a salad at all. All I have access to is low-quality crab mince, so we will try and adjust and maybe later repeat the recipe with actual freshly-caught crab.\n To compensate for the dishonorable crab product, we will make two versions: one will be sixroots cooked separately, with the thick  ,  , crab, and   sauce on the side to be dolloped over. The second version will be packed in ramekins, willed with melted butter, cheese, and milk sauce, topped with crab mince, and baked. Side \u2013  , shaped like flowers and glazed.\n Sixroots (makes 4 servings):\n Let us begin with the first one. Wash and peel two of each of these root vegetables:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  (or a handful of radishes), plus half a sweet  . Slice onion and cook it in butter on low heat until soft, or if you have time, until caramelized and darkened. Add   and  . Cut your vegetables into equally sized sticks. We will slowly cook them all in butter. First, cook carrots, parsnips, rutabaga, and turnips; they will take the longest to become silky soft, rotating to cook evenly. Forty minutes of slow simmer in hot butter. Remove from butter and drain; keep warm. Cook potatoes should take around 30 minutes, but it will depend on thickness. Remove and drain. Lastly, cook yams \u2013 they cook very quickly, 15 to 20 minutes.\n Crab sauce (makes 4 servings):\n The best time to make the sauce will be while the hardest of the vegetables are simmering in butter. Place the cooked onions in a saucepan, add butter, let it melt, add flour, a roughly equal amount as butter, mix, and cook together for a few minutes to get rid of that raw flour taste. Reduce heat and add whole   and stock. Whist it together and bring it to a gentle simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, some minced garlic if you wish, and a small spoon of  , which is encouraged but not necessary. Now, you will need two types of  : sharp yellow   and soft neutral-tasting cheese (gruyere). All cheese is to be freshly shredded. Incorporate and mix until the cheese melts and the sauce thickens. In another pan, briefly, cook shredded and drained crab so it dries. If you use re-cooked crab chunks, drain and pat it dry instead. It should not take more than a couple of minutes. Fold the crab shreds into the cheese sauce and mix. Keep warm\u2014last chance to taste and adjust the seasoning, too. Do not miss it. Transfer the sauce to a ramekin and place it under the roaring heat of a   or broiler. We want it to be heated and the top to crispen up.\n Serve the cooked buttery soft sixroots sticks handsomely arranged on a plate with a mug of lightly sweet wine. At the table, spoonfuls of the sauce are dolloped atop the butter-soft vegetables. Alternatively, place the hot ramekin on a plate in the center and arrange cooked root vegetables around it in an esthetically pleasing way. Sprinkle with fresh parsley.\n For the second version, we will use the same measurements as before, but we will thinly slice vegetables and line the bottom of greased ramekins with onions, cooked the same way as before. Drip liquid butter to cover onions halfway. Now, start circularly arranging root vegetables, alternating the colors. Pack them so they stay up, but leave enough space to pour the same sauce we made for the previous version. Put spoonfuls of crab mince on top and cover with more sauce. Preheat the oven to 400F and reduce to 375F before placing the dishes in. Bake covered with tin foil for 60 minutes; remove the cover top with some shredded cheese, and bake for 20 more minutes uncovered.\n Now for something absolutely unnecessary but fun because I had some leftover radishes to play around with. While the sixroots are baking, use a fine knife to cut radishes into flowers and toss them on a frying pan with a spoon of butter,  , and water to cover less than half the height of the shaped radishes. Cook until the water is gone and the mix turns reddish-radish glaze. Serve on the side or on top.\n And this is all there is to these two recipes. Which one do you prefer? I like the first one, as it just looks cuter on a plate, and dipping things is always fun. But in Velen, the dish is more of a collection of thick and soft roots and crab all tossed together in a buttery sauce on your plate. There are better substitutes for rock crab, but it is still delicious.\n Next time, my friends, we will be making every-popular crunchy handfood!\n , and until we meet again.\n Yours, Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n And another   flew by, and I am in great need of some comfort food from  . Some of the most common food there is  , preserved for storage or transportation. Smoking is one of these methods of preservation. The nation of   is one of the major exporters of smoked fish, and everywhere that smoked fish goes, folk learned to make a variety of tarts with it. Some recipes called for soaking smoked and dried fish to make it more palatable, while others mashed it, mixed it with tubers, and baked it in a nest shape. And today, we'll make one of such tarts.\n I used smoked   fillets this time (I recommend trout from   as the town knows its fish). You will also need three large starchy potatoes (you can use waxy, but they are just not as fluffy),  , fatty sour cream (or creme fraiche), and  . For the tart shell dough, you will need    , some raising powder,  ,  , a dollop of melted butter, and a generous amount of heavy  .\n Tart dough:\n I recommend you make the dough a day ahead. Simply mix all the ingredients together. It is a crumbly fatty dough, so it will look like it is not coming together as you kneed it, but eventually, it will be nice and smooth. Wrap it up al let it rest overnight in a cold place.\n The filling for the tarts is simple. Boil your potatoes until soft; 45 minutes is usually enough. Drain and let them sit in the colander to cool and dry. After that, peel the potatoes and push them through a fine sieve; add melted or softened butter, milk, and sour cream. Season generously with salt and white pepper, and add chopped   (not necessary).\n Tart filling:\n A single smoked trout is all you need. Shred two smoked fillets with two forks and make sure to remove any stray bones. Add the shed to your mashed potatoes and mix well.\n Take out your dough and roll it out one-third of an inch thick or so. Find a round bowl roughly the size you want your tars to be and use it to cut the dough into circles. Place a dollop of potato and fish mix in the center, flatten it, and bring it to a uniform shape, then lift the dough sides up, shaping it like a nest. Pinch the sides to keep it in shape, and gently press inwards as you do. Place the tarts onto a greased pan and scoop some smoked bacon drippings on top for additional flavor. Bake for 25 minutes on very high heat. When almost done, take out and brush with eggwash for additional color and place back for a couple of minutes. When the dough is golden, and the filling starts getting brown crust \u2013 it's time to pull the tarts out.\n When serving, I like topping them with a dollop of red  ; black caviar could work, too, and it's easier to find. A couple of sprigs of dill, and you're all set! I served them with nuggets of washed and cooked white fish. Condiments:   and  , like my momma used to eat it.\n There are many variants of smoked fish tarts. Some are infamous for their foulness, while others evoke a feeling of home and comfort. Amusingly enough, both could be found in Amn! I once had one of these tarts topped with red wine gravy and a fried egg. I did not complain.\n That is all for now. Next time we meet, we will be rolling   mince into balls! Salivating like a hungry   already!\n , and until we are hungry together again.\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Any adventurer who has ever visited  , the Jewel of the North, in the summer months has probably heard of or even partaken in the Midsummer Feast or the Grand Summer Feast, sponsored by the   and  , among other organizations that invest in tourism in the North. The summer's end celebration takes place in   every year, even if the exact date changes. It is renowned for copious harvest goods being carted to Neverwinter from all the surrounding towns, including  ,  ,  ,  , and many others. Merchants who do business with the far-away lands of   donate fireworks, both for personal use and to light the skies over Neverwinter. Adventuring folk who partake in celebrations embark on competitions gathering   flowers. In exchange, they receive festival tokens that can be exchanged for various foods prepared by the cooks and taverns. Sunite followers and clergy offer freshly made Squash Soup to the token carriers. To no surprise, the Sunite soup is made with ripe sweet  , roasted with   and cooked in   spices, sweetened with     and wild  . In my years of travel, I've encountered two versions of the dish: one is mashed and blended smooth and is somewhat similar to the   soup favored by the   of  , and the other is made similarly, but doubles the roasted squash: the first half of them is  blended into the soup and the rest are diced and allowed to soften further in the simmering soup, making it a chunky variant. Like my twin cousins, one of whom is as skinny as a  , and the other has the body of a jolly bakeress from the Dales. Having that difference between the two in mind, let us begin.\n Squash Soup\n Makes four servings:\n Like before, we will need to begin by roasting the squashes. Simply cut a large butternut squash in two lengthwise and scoop the seeds and stringy insides out. Use a tablespoon of roasting oil to coat a baking sheet. Sprinkle the cut side of the squash in salt,  , and sprinkle it with a bit of light brown sugar to get a little bit of extra caramelization. Flip the squashes cut side down and roast in a preheated oven at 400F for 30-40 minutes, or until a knife goes into the gourd with little to no resistance.\n While the squashes are cooking, prepare   for the rest of the recipe. Measure out the spices, wash, peel, and finely chop  ,  ,  ,  , and begin by sweating them in a bit of roasting oil with a  . We need them to sweat and soften but not get darker in color, so make sure to move the vegetables around the soup pot. In about 5 minutes, add in the spices and stir them into the vegetables. Continue cooking the vegetables and spices to develop the flavor further.\n Another five minutes or so later, add the   stock in, as well as a can of coconut milk. You can substitute chicken stock for a well-developed and reinforced vegetable stock, as plain veggie stock will not have enough flavor. By now, your squash is ready to be scooped out and added to the soup. Do not burn your fingers. Scrape all caramelized bits into the soup as well. Let the entire concoction simmer on low heat after being brought to a boil for about 30 minutes.\n Test the vegetables; they should now be soft. Fish out the  . Now, all we need to do is pass the soup through a veggie mill or blend it all together. Taste, adjust the seasoning, salt, pepper, and stir in honey. Taste and make sure the sweetness is to your liking (Sunites love the soup sweet, like sweet potato pie). Keep the soup warm for plating.\n Peanut Cracker\n Makes four servings:\n To go with the soup, I made a hard, brittle cracker topped with more peanuts. Simply mix all the ingredients together until smooth. Roll the dough on a flat sheet, brush the surface with a dash of oil, and sprinkle it with the crushed nuts. Roll them into the dough with a rolling pin. Bake on a greased baking sheet at 350F for about 15 minutes or until hardened. You can bake these crackers ahead of time. Letting them dry and bet brittle makes the crackers more fun to portion. You can stab it with a knife several times to crack it or just stop the crack on a sheet and watch it crack. Brish off all the extra peanuts and serve with the Sunite Squash Soup.\n To plate the soup, ladle it into a deep bowl. Gently place a spoonful of coconut milk you set aside for plating on top and sprinkle the dish with crushed peanuts. Optionally, you could also drizzle some honey on top of the soup and sprinkle with a bit of cilantro.\n Enjoy with a glass of light summer pink shimmerwine and maybe a handful of sweet spice-buns, and dont forget to toss a coin onto  's altar next time you visit one of her temples.\n And this is all I have for you this  . Until the next meal, your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Ah  , a busy, bustling, polluted jewel of the  . A city of industries, trade, thievery, religion, and, of course, food. If there were one thing, just one thing of note that ever came out of Tantras \u2013 that would be  . Small fat-crusted pie   filled with meats and pepper gravy. Curiously enough, even though Tantras was a fishing city on the  , Tantran baeranths were never filled with   nor  . Things that go inside were various smoked meats, usually  ,  , and  , with the 3:1:1 ratio. However, some claimed baeranths were filled with   and  , but you can rest easy, as in all the kitchens I've shuck into, I saw no pets being turned into yummy pastries.\n The version I am going to share will just use   and   as goats, frankly, scare me. Have you seen their eyeballs?! Also, I could not find goat meat at my local butcher's. We will make pie crust pastry from scratch and will let gravy form inside the pies as they cook. With taller and bigger baeranths \u2013 we would make pepper gravy on the side and pour it in after baking, but that will be a project for another  .\n For the crust dough, we will need nine ounces of  ; you might need more for dusting and adjusting the consistency, four ounces of water, two ounces of butter, and two ounces of lard, with a sprinkle of  , of course. You will also need a single egg to make eggwash. We will begin by putting water and fats on heat and bringing it to a boil. Once the fats are dissolved into the water, remove them from the heat and add in flour and salt. Keep kneading it with a spoon until it cools enough to be worked with your hands; transfer it to a kneading surface dusted with flour, and work until the dough comes together. Wrap and let it chill in the fridge until the dough toughens.\n While the dough is chilling, make the filling. One pound total will be more than enough; we are doing 3:2 minced beef (or bison, in my case) to pork chops, diced. Add chopped fresh  ,  , and  , and add a handful of spices: ground  , ground  ,  ,  ,  . All of this will be mixed with meat juices, forming gravy. If you make large pies and pour-in gravy, \u2013 we will return to it later. Mix the filling well, cover, and set aside as we shape the dough.\nIf your dough is hard and can remain stiff, roll it into small circles thick enough to remain structurally sound and put them atop a tankard to shape the crust. Work it and stretch it around the tankard's bottom and keep it chilled as you fill the dough cups with filling; place a smaller circle dough lid atop, and crinkle the sides to seal. Make some ventilation cuts in the lid and a circular opening at its center. Then, apply eggwash generously. Alternatively, you might have miniature pie molds; in that case, simply grease them, fill them with dough, and repeat the instructions above. Do not over-fill the cups, or the juices will simply bubble out.\n Bake in a preheated oven at 400F for about 20 minutes. You will know baeranths are ready when they are golden brown, like a Volhon sunset. Let them cool a bit before cutting, or, gods forbid, bite into them, or you will get scorched with the boiling gravy of meat juices and spices.\n I like serving Tantran baeranth on a plate of   leaves. It keeps your hands clean and lets you hold any other treats you would eat with the handpies. I like eating them together with cute tiny  , cherry  , picked pearl  , or fresh crunchy hot green peppers. The   sauce can work well with these pies too.\n Next time you are passing Tantras, buy a basketful for the road. You will thank me later. Thankfully, Tantran baeranths are spreading across the  , so you might not even need to travel across the continent to try them!\n That is all for this tenday. This dish is a delectable success, but the next recipe we will be talking about will actually be a drink from the cold, far-away land of spirits and witches \u2013  . And as a quick addition \u2013 a chill summer soup using that drink.\n Until we meet next, my friends,\n , yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good tidings, my dears. I am pleased to announce that this tenday I am on time! Today's dish is going to be a quick and easy taste of home. And the said home is in the grand City of Splendors,  ,  at the feet of the  . If you have a handful of   and some stock \u2013 you can whip up a bowl of Waterdhavian Cashew Soup.\n Let us begin with preparing the nuts. Spread your cashews on a sheet pan and roast them for twenty-five minutes until the nuts are golden, bringing up their natural sweetness and flavor.\n Cashew soup:\n As the cashews are roasting, finely chop one   and toss it in a pot with some oil, preferably something of lighter flavor. Add two cloves of  , smashed with the back of your knife, a thumb-sized dollop of   paste, a dash of pepper, and a dash of   for both warming flavor and color. Cook them all together until onions are soft, regularly mixing.\nNow we have a bit of time to take care of additional flavor and something to have with your soup. First, if you have fresh  , mash it together with neutral-tasting oil to extract the color and juices. Mash it well until your oil is green. Then strain the herbs and set them aside to drizzle in your soul as you serve the dish. You could dup bite-sized skewers of chicken meat into the soup, and it tastes great, but I am more in the mood for some flatbread.\n Flatbreads: \n You can make simple dough of one cup of yogurt, one cup  , a dollop of melted butter, and some salt and pepper. Add some soda and acid and quickly mix the dough until it's uniform and smooth. Pinch and roll out the dough as thin as you can; I like it to be very delicate and pan-fry up in some oil for color or just a heated pan for speed. Rip them by hand and toss some leftover chopped cilantro atop.\n Your cashews are probably already done, so take them out, and grind them to a nice powder and, add them to the onions, top with three cups of your favorite stock. Use two cups if you like your soup thick. Now mash the contents all together as it all warms up. Once you have made the onions and garlic into a smooth thick liquid, leave it alone and cook for six more minutes.\nNow you are ready to serve. Ladle the hot thick homey cashew soup, toss some cashew or cilantro atop, and drizzle with cilantro oil. That is it. Simple, warming, sweet, and savory. Get a handwheel of herb and bacon-stuffed cheese, drizzle some oil on it and its all here.\n Simple dish this time, and I will continue with another simple dish next time. How do you like smoked fish pastries from  ? I highly recommend you try this. My halfling soul is gitty from thinking about all the leftovers I will have!\n Until the next time,   my friends.\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo \n Good tidings, my friends. Have you ever sailed to the  ? If you haven't, the grand city of   shoud be your destination if you are, like me, searching for new foods. If, for some odd reason, Mezro is unavailable,   should be your next choice. Port Nyanzaru exports a fair amount of spices grown and harvested in the jungles of  , and the city itself is a marvel of colors and huge scaly beasts they call  . Despite some fine attempts to colonize the peninsula and erase local gods and culture, there are still some   foods and traditions to spotlight.\n Asa wat is a thick dark spice stew of  ,  ,  , and generous amounts of local   seasoning. For this stew, you will need four tuna steaks, a cup of red lentils, one red onion, several generous spoonfuls of spiced  ,  , oil, water, or vegetable stock, and a collection of spices. For tuna, traditionally, Tabaxi use thick cuts of the fish through the spine, but you can also use boneless flank steaks. I used yellowfin tuna from the  .\n Stew: \n Let us begin with butter. It can be done ahead of time, and butter \u2013 saved to be used later. Take clarified butter and melt it in a saucepan. Add  ,  , garlic, chppped white onion, chopped  , black  , chopped sweet peppers,  ,  ,  , and  . Keep simmering the butter mixture on low flames for at least an hour. Be ready for an assault of beautiful fragrance to permeate the entire home as you infuse it. When done, strain the butter and set aside to set and chill.\n Kibe:\n Drizzle a skillet with oil and heat it up while patting tuna dry on all sides. It might take several goes with a towel. Salt the steaks on all sides and sear them for about two minutes on each side. Set aside.\n Put a soup pot on medium-low flames and let it heat up. Finely chop, or even better \u2013 grate the red onion and add it to the hot pan, along with the juice. No, I did not forget about oil. The onion goes in dry. Keep an eye on the onion and move it around as it fries. This part produces a smell as heinous as a  's pantaloons, so do not get scared. It is supposed to stink. When some of the onion gets caked on the bottom, the onion changes color to brown in about 4 minutes' time. Now add in a drizzle of  , minced garlic, salt, and a handful of berbere. Cook, stirring for six more minutes. Now add two tankard-fulls of vegetable stock or water and about six heaping large spoons of spiced butter. And a special spice mix of cardamom, black pepper, and cinnamon. cumin, cloves, and  . Mix and stew for eight to ten more minutes.\n While the stewing is happening, we can quickly make batter for   bread. It's simply a mix of sour   and    . We want the consistency of very sticky, almost-holding-together dough made with a dash of salt and pepper. It will be fried in a pan with no oil on both sides.\n Now it's time to add dried red lentils to the stew. Mix, and cook for ten minutes covered as you are frying kita. Place your fish stakes into the stew, making sure they are submerged. If your liquid level goes down, add a bit more stock. Cover, and cook for ten more minutes on low flames.\n And it's serving time. Fill up your bowl with the stew, lentils, and a fish steak. Add some coarsely chopped   and   on top. I served it with kita cut into bite-sized pieces with cow's yogurt and honey to dup leftover bread into for dessert. As I am a northerner, they served me a platter of pickled vegetables with   (haha) berries, something that I emulated here.\n This dish is fairly easy to make it has a beautifully warming spiced taste with thick complexity. If you find the stew a tad too bitter from red onions, I can recommend you add a bit of honey to it \u2013 it does wonders for the taste.\n I hope you try this dish for yourself and appreciate the taste of Chult. A good glass of sweet red wine goes well with the spices, but I like having some berry tea; I hope it does not offend anyone's purist sensibilities.\n That would be all for today. Next time \u2013   and the  !\n , my lovelies,\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n And we are back to the beloved rustic and adventure-filled  . What waterway do you think of when I say \"Dalelands\"?  ? Alright... What is the second waterway you think of when I say \"Dalelands\"? That's right,   or River Verire. Visitors to   know the river and its scaly bounty well.\n One of the   served in the Ashaban areas of the Dales is trout, and it can be cooked in a fanciful Cormyrean eatery style \u2013 a delicately grilled filet flavored with tangy black     and fresh  . This dish was once famously served at the  , overlooking River Ashaba, as a part of a long feast of spicy   stew, broiled  , and even a roasted  ! I tried to find the recipe, for your amusement, my friends, facing the overlord of the Roost's kitchens \u2013 dire  , a   woman of a terrifying bulk. To preserve my gentle hide, I'll share a more rustic version of the dish, where trout is stuffed with sweet and zesty apricot relish and served on a platter of flavored crusty    .\n This one is another easy recipe, and I recommend you have a grill cast iron pan ready or, at the very least, a seasoned frying pan. Also, my recipe uses dried apricots in place of fresh fruit, as when I worked on it, it was hard to find it fresh, but the final flavor worked out well! Let's begin!\n Ashaba trout (2 servings):\n We will begin by soaking dried apricots in cold, sugared water overnight to let them rehydrate. When ready to cook, slice the apricots in halves. On an un-greased skillet, place the one-third red onion and rehydrated apricots sliced side down and heat them up. We want to char and blacken onion and apricots to give the relish we will make out of them a pleasant smoky and tangy taste.\n Now, we need to remember that dried apricots tend to lack the fruit's sweetness, so we will remedy that. I strained half a tankard of sweet juices from canned peach and made it into syrup, adding sugar to taste. Usually, you would need no more than two small spoons of sugar and then reduce the juices to one-fourth of a tankard.\n Next, we are going to make the relish. Roughly chop the softened and blackened onion and apricots, and add a pinch of chopped fresh   red wine  . Mix and taste. Adjust seasoning with a pinch of salt, pepper, and a spoon or so of apricot or pear syrup. Split the relish in two servings, one-third of the total amount and two-thirds. One-third will be used to make a topping, and two-thirds will be stuffed into trouts.\n Put the smaller portion of the relish on the medium-low flame in a skillet with a bit of oil and the rest of the peach or apricot syrup and slowly cook regularly, stirring until the mix darkens and caramelizes.\n Now, we will prepare trout, but before we do \u2013 lightly brush a grill pan with grilling oil and pre-heat it. Remove tails, heads, and bones from the trout (best if you ask your butcher to do that for you). Dab the fish's skin dry. Lightly brush it with grilling oil and sprinkle with salt. Open the filets and sprinkle the insides with salt and pepper. Spoon the fruit relish in, drizzle over it with truffle oil, and add thinly sliced   and sliced truffles.\n Carefully transfer the fish to a hot grill and cook for about six minutes per side, covered, so handsome grill marks are left on the fish skin. And this is all that we need to do.\n I am not going into details of rice cooking as we've done it many times. Wash your rice, soak in water, and cook with salt and pepper until soft and flaky. Add two large spoons of boiling hot water to the   to release its color and flavor and stir it into the rice. Transfer rice to two small frying pans and cook on medium heat with the bottom of the pan greased with butter. We want a light crust to form in the rice, but we don't want it to get dark in this case; we just need texture and form on the plate.\n To plate Ashaba trout, flip the rice onto a plate; it will retain the pan's shape. Gently Transfer grilled trout onto the rice and top the fish with caramelized fruit relish. Sprinkle the dish with chiffonaded on the dish and decorate it with sliced apricots and oiled truffles.\n When I tried the combination of apricots and trout I expected to dislike it, because fish and fruit! Unspeakable! I would even go as far as to recommend the dish to folk who dislike the taste of fish, as the fruit gives fluffy trout flesh a distinctly non-fishy flavor.\n This is all I have for you this time, my friends. Next  's dish will be of dwarvish persuasion, and this weekend, we will try some tavern snacks cooked in  .\n Until next time,  \n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  's recipe has been gaining popularity across the   for several years now, originating from the city of  . Unsurprisingly, a coastal trade city would have a seafood-heavy dish or many dishes. Almost anything goes into this stew, thick with   and   with  .  ,  ,  ,  ,  , various types of  , all have a place in a big pot of  . The ingredients usually include whatever was brought ashore that day by the city's fishers.\n Stew (4 servings):\n The taste base of this stew is tomatoes. Add a drizzle of   to a soup pot and heat it up. Add tomato paste and, regularly stirring, cook until it turns a deep red color similar to red bricks. Do not be afraid of some of it becoming stuck to the pot's bottom; we want caramelization, and later we will deglaze the bottom anyway. This will likely take you more than 20 minutes on low flame.\n While the tomato paste is cooking, dice up two medium  , white parts of one   (wash it well), 4 garlic cloves, one large celery stalk, and a single roasted and jarred sweet red pepper. On a separate saute\u00e8ing pan, heat up one small spoonful of   and twice that amount of olive oil. Saut\u00e9eing all vegetables together is fine to save time. We want them to unlock the cooked aroma and improve their flavor. It will cook for about thirty minutes on medium heat. Do not forget to stir the vegetables to avoid burning. Don't forget to sprinkle it with   and  .\n Now that the tomato paste is darkened, pour in your chopped tomatoes and  . Scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze, as we want all of that flavor. Bring all to a boil, reduce heat, and keep it simmering. Now transfer your vegetables into the pot, mix well, and add  ,  ,  , and hot pepper. We will be cooking it a bit more, so they will lose their color if you're using fresh herbs.\n As the stew is bubbling away, it's time to prepare the seafood. Add white wine to a lidded sauce pot, crush the rest of your garlic, and add it to the poaching wine with a squeeze of half a lemon's juice and a bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Once it's bubbling, add your clams, prawns, or any other shellfish you have ready. Add a teaspoon of sea salt, freshly ground pepper, and a handful of chopped parsley. Cover and reduce heat to simmer. The cooking should be fast. In about four minutes, the clams will open their shells \u2013 this means they are cooked. It might take a bit more time, mind you.\n Slice flounder fillets into bite-sized pieces and add them to the simmering stew. Transfer the shellfish into the stew. Add peas. Now the leftover poaching wine becomes a delicious seafood stock. Crank the heat under that poaching pot and let it reduce by half. When done, add it to the stew and mix.\n Now it is ready. Taste it and adjust seasoning and acidity to your liking. The mix of tomatoes, wine, and shellfish stock will result in a spicy, slightly sweet, and savory stew. Ladle it into your serving bowl and serve the rest of the wine with the dish. I can recommend   from the nation of  , south of Baldur's Gate.\n When serving, sprinkle it with the rest of your chopped parsley. Also, I suggest you make croutons to be served with the stew. Make wide slices of white   and roast them in an oven until they harden. Take them out, and generously rub a clove of fresh garlic into each. Hardened bread will serve as a grater. Top with dry and hard cheese and bake again. That is all.\n Despite its many ingredients, Baldurian seafood stew is easy to make, and the resulting meal would be as welcomed on the table of a Baldurian duke as it would be on a  's table. Yet another dish I highly recommend you try.\n This is all I had for you this tenday, my friends. I have one more Baldurian dish for you in the works, as the city has become staggeringly popular lately.\n Hale be thou, my friends, and  .\n Yours as always,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good tidings and well met, my dear friends. Today we will talk about two of the noblest of the beasts found in the   \u2013   and  . Even though both are abundant virtually everywhere, we will make two stops and use their particular recipes in one dish.\n The star of this platteral celebration will be   loin recipe from the   \u2013 an important caravan stop along cold  . The same recipe can be applied to a whole suckling piglet, but a loin is what we have, and a loin will have to do. The pig will be tied up, plastered with spices and herbs, and roasted atop  . The side dish will be cooked and spiced cabbage and greens you could always be sure to see served in  's   inn. Both of these recipes are quite easy, and we will talk about how to use up the leftovers in the next  's recipe.\n Pork:\n We will start with making a wet rub for our pork loin. This recipe is for three pounds of pork loin. Mix together one big spoon of dried  , a big spoon of powdered  , the same amount of  ,  , dried savory leaves, crushed hot red  , and small spoons full of  , black pepper, and dried  . Add in one-fourth tankards of   and a drizzle of any type of savory sauce (like something   called \"Worcestershire sauce\"). Add chopped fresh parsley and mix into a paste. Prepare the loin by tying it with butcher's string for it to retain its rough brick-like shape during cooking. Encircle one side of the loin with string, and on the opposite side, twist both sides of the string and loop around the pork lengthwise. On the other end of the loin, meet the strings together, twist, and loop width-wise. Tie it tight, sprinkle with a bit of salt on all sides, and plaster the loin with the spice and herb mix. Cover tightly, trying to avoid anything being exposed to air, set aside, and keep in a chill place for at least an hour.\n Now let us prepare red potatoes. Slice them all in halves, lengthwise. Take the four biggest halves, and hassle-back cut them without slicing through, but just to fan the potato out. Toss the potatoes in olive oil, pepper, salt, a dash of dried mustard, and paprika. We want an even coat of oil and seasoning. Line a baking receptacle with potatoes and place the loin on top. Arrange thin slices of garlic on top and slightly press them in. Preheat your oven to 375 \u00b0F and bake the dish covered or sealed in tinfoil for 50 minutes. Then uncover and bake for ten more. Check internal temperature. It should be at least 150 \u00b0F. If it is not there yet, bake for ten more.\n Cabbage:\n Cooking the cabbage and greens will take less time, so time it at 25 minutes. You will need oil, five garlic cloves, half a small head of cabbage, sweet peppers, and a handful of collard greens. For seasoning, we will use salt, pepper,  ,  , crushed and mashed garlic, and   seeds. Slice cabbage in medallions, forming long ribbons. Drizzle oil in a pan, place cabbage into the oil, and sprinkle caraway, salt, pepper, and cumin. If you want a bit of sweetness, add a squeeze of   paste. Pour in one-fourth tankard of water, add thinly sliced sweet peppers, cover, and let it come to a boil and create steam. After five minutes, uncover and cook for five-to-ten minutes more, stirring, until most of the water is evaporated. Do not be afraid to overcook cabbage \u2013 it is a hardy vegetable. Remove the thick core from collard greens and slice them into ribbons of the same size as cabbage and add to the pan, stirring them in. Cook for five minutes and remove from heat; cover until ready to serve.\n To serve \u2013 gently remove the herb and spice paste from the pork and cut the strings, gently pulling them out. Thinly slice the loin. Arrange the cabbage and greens at the bottom of the plate into twirled strings if you can manage it without making a mess. Place the pork loin on top, gently pressing it together to make it appear whole. Arrange potatoes around the plate in an aesthetically pleasing manner. For garnish, I sprinkled it with fresh minced parsley, arranged cooked garlic slices on top of the pork, and made battered and quickly fired   leaves. This dish goes well with   wine; its fragrant spice and slight saltiness nicely complement the soft pork loin roast.\n And now that the dish is done, it is time to enjoy it. You will likely have leftover pork from this meal. Do not feed it to the pigs, though! Save the slices for the next morning. I will share a quick morningfeast recipe using the meat in the next tenday or so.\n I hope you enjoyed the Savage Frontier eveningfeast as much as I did collecting and replicating the recipes. Do not overdo on the wine... Or do overdo on the wine; I am not your mother...\n Until the next time we meet.\n  my dears and we will speak again very soon!\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met and good tidings, my friends. I am giddy with excitement over the fancy dish I am bringing you this  . I am also nervous as it was a hard one to figure out, and I did fail the first time I embarked on this journey. The dish in question is  . It was first offered to me in the town of  . I turned it down because adventure called, but several winters later, I came across the inn called the   in a small town of   in  , and what do you know, Beef and Oysters Barnabas was looking at me alluringly from the menu, stained with grease and wine.\n The dish is a strange combination of   or   meat, slowly stewed in an aromatic mixture of vegetables,    , and   liquor. Hours later, the beef was sliced and plated atop some  , topped with   and fried fresh oysters, and finished with thickened and reduced stewing liquid of dark red velvet. My first attempt had a side of roasted bone marrow and savory cottage     for dipping. However, the less said about that failed attempt, the better. The second set of sides I blatantly stole from another eatery in Cormyr, as well as something you can try in   -  , small sweet beets, sliced, boiled, and cooked in a thick glave of honey. And, of course, beet greens were not wasted \u2013 I turned them into yet another side dish.\n For this tenday's recipe, I will be sharing a collection of two attempts, so expect some inconsistency and pay attention to the explanations I provide. A word of caution \u2013 this dish relies on using fresh oysters, as canned ones will disintegrate into smelly mush. Trust me. Therefore, I strongly advise against using canned oysters. However, you can substitute clam juice for oyster liquor or even mix the two.\n Beef & sauce (2 generous servings):\n Preparation begins with trimming excess fat from the surface of the short ribs and brisket. You can chop the ribs\u2014they are here just to flavor the sauce. We will discard the bones and use the meat for something else. If you want to skip the short ribs step\u2014the dish will still work well. Slice the brisket into two portions of equal size. Sprinkle all the meat with salt on both sides and set aside in cold storage to absorb the salt for at least 40 minutes.\n Heat a skillet with neutral frying oil, dry the meat on all sides as well as you can, and sear cubed ribs and two portions of brisket on medium-high heat for two or three minutes to get some color. We did not pepper the meat because we do not want it to get burned in hot oil. Transfer the meat to a side bowl, turn off the heat, and wipe the fat off. Add 1/4 tankard of wine or stock and deglaze, scraping the pan to save all the delicious flavor.\n Now for the main stage: melt a large spoon of butter in a cast-iron Dutch oven and sweat diced  ,  ,  , sliced  , and sliced  . On medium flame, stirring regularly, transfer the meat in once the vegetables have a golden, softened sheen. Add the deglazed liquid as well    , port wine, and clam juice. Add parsley stems and spices. Make sure you have enough liquid to cover the meat almost completely. If you don't have enough liquid, start adding half a cup of each liquid extra. For me, it took an additional cup of wine. Cover and place into a preheated oven at 250F for 2 hours. Check liquid levels every hour. After 2 hours, test the meat and see if it is buttery soft; we can move on to the next step but do not be afraid of stewing it for up to 3 hours, but always check the tenderness and liquid level.\n Remove the short ribs and discard them. Remove the brisket and set it aside, keeping it warm and moist. Strain the stewing liquid, discard the vegetables, and transfer it to a saucepan. Reduce on high heat until it thickens to about one-and-a-half tanks of sauce. Taste the sauce as it reduces, adjust the seasoning, and you might want to add half a tankard of wine to bring up the sweetness. When the sauce is reduced and you are ready to plate, whisk in a big spoon of     to thicken and a bit of cold butter. Stir the butter constantly as it melts until it is incorporated into the sauce completely. Slice the the portions and plate.\n Now, let us talk about the oysters and the side. Both dishes must be done in the last hour of sewing to ensure all ingredients are fresh and warm. We will start with oysters. Use fresh oysters only; do not use canned. \n Fried oysters (makes two servings):\n Shuck the oysters and reserve the juice for the sauce. Remove the meat from the shells, keeping each oyster in one piece. Place   in one bowl and beat   into another. Mix   with   and   and keep it in the third bowl. Preheat a frying pan with oil \u2013 we will be frying the oysters as soon as we coat them (deep frying is an option, too, if you have oil to spare). Each oyster will be rolled in flour, dipped in egg, then rolled in flour, then dipped in egg again. Try to keep them uniform. After the second egg dip, roll them in breadcrumbs and fry immediately until darkened and goldened.\n We will discuss rice very briefly. Use a single tankard of rice per serving. Wash the rice to remove the starch. Cook rice with a teaspoon of white vinegar. One cup of rice will need about two cups of water to cook. Bring to a boil and cook covered until the water absorbs and the rice is flaky.\n Now, let's quickly talk about the sides. Roasted bone marrow with savory cottage cheese griddle cakes is an easy option, and I don't think I need to talk much about it, but we will be talking about Marsember beets cooked in honey.\n Marsember beets (makes two servings):\n Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and reduce to simmer. Trim the greens off and simmer the beets for fifty minutes. We want the beets to be soft but not mushy, as we will continue cooking them in honey. Strain and let the beets cool. Melt the butter in a saucepan and whisk together with spices and honey. When beets are safe to handle, use the back of a knife to remove the skin and slice them into inch-thick medallions. Toss them into the hot honey cover evenly, and simmer until the glaze thickens and coats them evenly, five to eight minutes. The honey will be colored bright red! To plate, simply transfer medallions onto a plate and spoon the leftover glaze over.\n Lastly, a quick simmered salad of beet greens. Wash and chop the reserved greens. Melt half a spoon of butter, slice half a shallot, and soak it in butter until soft; add beet greens, and season with salt and pepper. Toss in butter and half a tankard of water and simmer covered until stems soften. Remove cover, add sliced   and simmer until liquid is gone.\n And now, at last, we can plate everything! Scoop rice onto one half of a plate and roughly form it into a half-  shape. Place sliced beef on the other side of the plate. Pile fried oysters over the rice and sprinkle it with some parsley. Spoon thickened sauce over the brisket's far side. Serve a small plate of Marsember beets and a small bowl of beet leaves salad. Eat with a glass of Westgate Ruby. Some bread drizzled with oil would go well with the dish, too.\n This tenday's dish was a lot of work, and I am exhausted from just recounting the full process! But trust this halfling; the buttery soft meat, crispy oysters, and delicious sauce are all worth it.\n  for now, next recipe will involve sausages and mint! Morningfeast of the champions.\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, my friends. In today's strange culinary journey, we will visit the infamous City of Serpents,  . The city's significant   population and influences make it a truly strange place for those not used to that particular   culture. Even simple servings of   there is often served with a raw egg floating in a tankard, so request your bartender to leave out the egg when you visit.\n But today, we will talk about a special and somewhat gruesome dish called  . Snakes eating snakes! Preposterous! But let's be adventurous and try the dish highly recommended by   himself after his visit to the  .\n If you can't get your hands on fresh   meat, feel free to use any other snake, and of course, if you failed to do that, like yours truly, use snake sausage meat! I got my hands on some   sausage, and this is what the stew will be made with, and I won't hear any criticism about authenticity!\n Broth:\n The recipe comes in two parts. The broth and the stew. For the broth, you will need beef marrow bones,  ,  ,  and  . The original recipe called for a mix of  , beef, and snake bones for the broth, but you can use what you have handy. For spices, use  , black  ,  ,  ,  , star  , and  . I added some roasted   to the roast pan. Place all of your vegetables and bones onto a sheet pan and roast them on medium-high for at least forty minutes, but all you need is to keep your eye on them and remove them from the oven after everything browns. Transfer your browned items into a pan. Place your herbs and spices into a cloth bundle, tie it up, and add to the pot. Use stock or water to deglaze the sheet pan, and add it to the pot and enough water to cover the pot's contents. Bring to a boil and simmer on low for at least two hours to extract all the flavor. You can either let bone marrow melt into the stock or take it out and set it aside for later. Strain your stock and discard solids. If you are chilling it overnight, you can remove congealed fat off the top after the stock is cold; otherwise, carefully skim the fat from the top and set it aside for later.\n Stew:\n Now to the stew. You will need snake meat, onion, celery, garlic, carrots,  , lemon juice, soy sauce, spring onions, and   (black fungus is a good substitution on some worlds). You will also need   or starch,  ,  , and a pinch of  .\n Add a drizzle of   into your cast iron pot and sweat bits of  , chopped onions, and garlic. When golden, add chopped snake sausage, celery, and green onions and cook more, regularly stirring. In the next step, add diced potatoes and moth mushrooms, and fill up with the stock you made beforehand. If you need more liquid, feel free to add water. If you use dried mushrooms, soak them in warm water until soft, and make sure to rinse them in water to get rid of any sand. Add salt and pepper, soy sauce, and a pinch of sugar. Now, let's return to skimmed fat and bone marrow. Make a marrow slurry with flour and softened marrow, and add some of the skimmed fat, mix it all together into a paste, and add to your stew to thicken it. I used arrowroot starch. Bring the stew to a boil. Cover and place in an oven at 300F for two hours. After two hours, move back to the stovetop and cook covered on low for an hour more. Taste, adjust seasoning, and serve with bread croutons, topped with cheese.\nLike any other stew, it holds great and tastes better the next day. I Recommend serving some rice as additional starch on the side.\n I hope you enjoyed Black Adder Stew or at least me telling you how to cook snake into a delicious savory treat. Maybe next time we can make some grilled snake kebabs? I wonder if   is edible. Pair the stew with sweet red wine, something from  , as it is not far from Hlondeth and is famous for its quality.\n As always,   my friends, and until the next time.\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n If you, my dear reader, consider yourself an   who runs their schemes, plots, and romps out of the glorious City of Splendors,  , you are probably well familiar with the   and its many quality dishes and libations. Where else would one aspiring treasure seeker stop but at the very tavern and inn built atop the entrance into the dreaded  , the gargantuan dungeon lorded over by a bearded old mage (not  , one assumes). However, those of us who are not opposed to a less-savory establishment end up at  , a rowdy dive just off  , with no virgin in sight. The interior is always kept dark and shuttered; some say it's because the Bowels lost its window glass an eon ego, while others claim it's to service some dark creatures who sizzle in the sun. You can find a hireling, a  , or death in such a place. I've had the \"pleasure\" of visiting the Bowels on two occasions, once on adventuring business and once to get a meal. Both times, the dive's reputation proved to be truthful, and I had to spill some battle-  at   who acted untoward at a lady such as I. But I learned that a   with a collection of incantations ready can easily remove such individuals from her way. Let's just say some of them needed serious healing magics applied to their flayed rumps. Oh, and if you throw spells around, make sure not to target its structural pillars, or you will receive the exact spells fired back at your own rump. Ouch.\n But we are not here to talk about spell-punishments dispensed at some ungentlemanly thugs. We are here to talk about food. Today's dish, or more precisely, meal, is what I just call The Bowels of the Earth Provender\u2014two dishes served as a meal that still to this day is about ninety percent of the Bowels' menu. The first dish is a bowl of hearty, if not sloppy, soup of   and   cooked with meat scraps, typically of porcine nature; however, one never knows. The second one is a   of various bits of fowl, served with spiced or herbed butter, smothered over sliced hard, grilled, rich     loaves, sometimes packed with dark dried raisins that go well with p\u00e2t\u00e9. I shan't pretend this is high cuisine worthy of a sultan or a  , but I can confidently say that it's delicious and filling. If you befriend the rotund cook, he will allow you to purchase a couple of jars of p\u00e2t\u00e9 to take home in exchange for a story of daring adventure, as long as you don't tell the tavernkeep.\n Stupidly enough, this   misplaced her notes on the recipes penned here. I had to reconstruct what I prepared from memory and bits of conversations, as well as pictures I've shared from this dish several   back. Let us begin, and   help me...\n Fowl Liver P\u00e2t\u00e9\n Makes four small servings:\n Optional seasonings: lemon and pepper seasoning or red pepper and lime seasoning, more dried marjoram.\nFor preserving: two large or four small ramekins, 1/3 cup of clarified butter.\nFor presentation: twigs of rosemary, sage of bay leaves, nuts.\n The beauty of p\u00e2t\u00e9s is that they can be made ahead of time and sealed with clarified butter to preserve them for a week or much more if frozen in your ice box. The cooking process itself is a bit messy but painless, even for an amateur cook, and probably that is why the Bowels have not removed them from their menus for over a century!\n Let us begin by preparing the ingredients. Finely but roughly chop a  , remove hard stems from  , and chop the fresh herbs. Keep the butter cool and cube it, as we will be adding it to the mashed livers when they are cooked. Chicken livers would need preparation only if you buy them freshly butchered. Livers are soft and mushy organs but would need white skins and membranes removed with a very sharp knife. After that, try to drain the organs, dry them off as much as you can (they will release plenty of liquid when cooking), and roughly chop. Frozen livers will be much softer and will release a lot of liquid, but no need to panic. Cook and reduce the juices all the same!\n Preheat a bit of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the shallots for about five minutes until they become translucent. Add chopped marjoram and fry for a minute or two more to soften the shallots. Make sure not to burn the herbs. If you notice the coloring, reduce the heat to medium-low flames. Add   and minced garlic, and after two more minutes, add livers, turning the heat back to medium. Add in   and continue cooking the ingredients all together for about eight minutes, breaking the livers apart and occasionally moving them around the pan. You will know that the livers are done when on the inside, they are no longer bloody by breaking a piece apart with a spoon. Note, if your herb and onion are starting to look overcooked by the time the fries go in, simply remove them from the pan and set aside until it's time to mash everything into a paste.\n Transfer livers and vegetables to a food processor. If your pan is still full of juices, crank up the heat and reduce the liquid until it becomes a thick sauce. If the pan is just slightly moist, sprinkle a bit of stock, water, or sherry into the pan to deglaze. Transfer the juices to the food processor.\n Run the processor to shop all the ingredients, turning them into a mash. Taste for seasoning and spices and adjust the flavor. Turn the machine back on and start adding cubes of butter, a couple of pieces at a time, incorporating it all. Note that the p\u00e2t\u00e9 can take in a lot of butter, making it smooth and flavorful. The final step I find optional, but if you happen to overcook the livers, it can help you reduce the p\u00e2t\u00e9's grainy texture. Pushing p\u00e2t\u00e9 after the food processor through a fine sieve would make sure it's fluffy and smooth.\n Divide the finished and still warm p\u00e2t\u00e9 between ramekins and slam them against the table to ensure there are no air bubbles. Air bubbles mean spoilage! Smooth the tops over and pour melted clarified butter to seal the p\u00e2t\u00e9 and keep it edible. From there, chill the ramekins and serve later. You can flavor the clarified butter by melting it in a pan with some herbs or spices with sea salt but that is not a prerequisite.\n 'Dicing vegetables in roughly even size makes all piees cook with equal speed. Lentil and Pea Pork Stew\n Makes four generous servings:\n Spice satchel:\n Note that if you do not have a smocked ham hock or dont have three hours to cook it, you can double the amount of ham, but make it smoked and use a mixture of pork and chicken stock. But if you decide to follow the full recipe, place the bones of smoked hock in four cups of chicken stock and top it with water as needed to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer for at least three hours to include the stock with flavor. Don't be afraid to add more stock or water to replace evaporated liquid.\n Test the ham hock; it should be soft and fall off the bone. You can shred it and add it to the soup or set it aside and use it for something else later. But we will need the stock \u2013 it's cooking liquid, and there should be at least four cups of stock left. Strain the stock and remove any floating impurities. If you used bones, dispose of them.\n Prepare  : dice guanciale,  ,  , and  , mince  , and slice   into half-rings after washing it thoroughly, of course.\n In a big soup pot, start by frying diced guanciale. Cook it on medium or medium-low flames to gently release all of its abundant fat and seasonings. Once the fat is rendered (you might want to remove some to make roux, but the stew would likely eagerly absorb it all) and the lardons are transparent, add diced vegetables and sweat them on medium-low flames in pork fat. Do not forget to discard any guanciale skin at this point. Garlic will go in last to keep it from burning. Regularly stir the vegetables to coat them evenly and continue sweating them to unlock all their natural aromas until softer and golden; it might take about eight minutes. The optional step is to sprinkle a teaspoon of flour over the vegetables if you feel there is too much pork fat in the pan. Stir well to have the fat absorbed into the flour, and cook for a couple of minutes to get rid of the raw flour taste. Do not burn them; some browning and color if fine. Toss in diced ham and let it get a bit of color. If the pot is too crowded, brown ham dice in a skillet and then transfer it into the soup pot.\n Add split peas and lentils (dried), and remember to wash them first. Top the pot with all of the stock we made earlier, and add water if there is not enough broth. Stir the seasonings and herbs in and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for fifty-sixty minutes. The resulting stew will be chunky, the ham will be soft, and the peas and lentils will be soft and mushy.\n The two dishes should be served with dark bread with raisins, toasted over a fire, or on a grill. Make a side of garlic butter and dust it with  . A good tipping for the stew is a mash of fresh marjoram,  , and     with a bit of all. The herb mash can be additionally seasoned with some hot peppers and can be stirred into the stew or adde to the toast. Of course, a rough dark   needs to accompany the meal.\n It's great that all parts of this meal freeze well, so you can make a lot ahead of time and store the stew and p\u00e2t\u00e9 in the ice box until ready to slurp happily once again.\n And another meal from Waterdeep is recorded for your pleasure. Please note, friends, that I shall be traveling the next   and there will likely be not a recipe nor a test kitchen run! But it does not mean there will not be eating and cooking! Some of the dishes featured in the print copy of   will be cooked for friends and consumed with some tasty  !\n  and until we cook again.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n . No other nation on the   has seen so much strife and change in its recent history\u2014the land\u2013as lush as it is warm. If you are anything like me and have ever hitched a ride with a merchant's caravan along the  , openly, in exchange for some simple magic tricks, or while pretending to be a sack of winter tubers, you are likely familiar with  . A walled oasis of civilization along the endless greenery of the  , soaked in humidity and chilled by tree shade. Today's dish comes from an eatery there, made famous by a certain infamous writer, whose name rhymes with \"bolo\" \u2013 the  . The eatery will get you cold ale, platters of food, and back-rubs from the proprietor's daughters. Go with the tall one with raven hair. She will crack every tired joint, and you will ask for more. Ah, yes, the dish. It is a simple combination of chopped Weldathyn  , wild or farmed  , dried  , and much powdered  . Of course, it peaked my curiosity, and, along with you, my dear reader, we will try and reproduce the so-called  .\n Bowl of hares (makes 4 servings):\n Prepare your hares caught in the  . Skin and gut them. Now, the cooks of Mosstone butchered the animals into bite-sized chunks, but I am nowhere as proficient with game butchery, so we will remove hares' legs and paws and break the carcass in two. We will leave the meat to marinate overnight to soften it. For the marinade, you will need     peel, lemon juice, a sprig of rosemary, a sprig of  , crushed  , crushed   from  ,  brown  , salt, pepper, oil, a cup of   from   and your best sweet and acidic red  , I used   from  . Mix the marinade well and submerge the hare bits overnight.\n The next day, strain your marinade and set aside the liquid in a pan, cooking on medium heat to reduce the liquid and concentrate the flavor. Pat your hare meat dry and quickly brown on all sides in a bit of oil. About two minutes per side should suffice. Set aside, and in the same pot, add some butter and finely (or not so finely) chopped leeks. Cook on low flame until leaks are sweet. Now, transfer the meat back, pour in the now-reduced marinade, and add enough stock, wine, and water to cover. Add generous heapings of powdered cloves and cinnamon to the stew and bring to a boil\u2014taste to adjust the flavor. Cover and cook on a slow simmer for three hours. I added   powder and sweet apples to thicken and add flavor. If you want your hare stew to look more presentable, use whole cinnamon and cloves tied in a little satchel to keep the liquid smoother. But be generous with the amounts of spices \u2013 they are the spotlight in the dish.\n Eggbread (4 slices):\n Traditionally, a bowl of hares is served with round slices of fried up  , which is easy to whip up. You will need to beat eggs and a dash of cream, soak your day-old stale bread in it, and then pan-fry it.\n Voila, let us hope you like the result as much as   liked his serving. At the Oak-Father's Boon, each bowl was filled with chunks of leeks and soft buttery meat and packed with eggbread for dipping. But I think the dish is filling, so smaller bowls can satisfy a single person.\n This exercise in Tethyrean cuisine was riveting. Next time, I want to make the dish even better. If you try to iterate on the recipe, please do not hesitate to share your results. Next time, we will travel to the southeast from Tethyr to the mysterious   for another bean dish.\n Until next time, my friends.   and stay culinarily curious!\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Good tidings, dear friends.\nI have such a treat to share with you!\n Today we are continuing our tour across the limited yet curious menu from the   of  . Even though the cook continued to shoo me away from the kitchens, I saw enough to put my findings to parchment for you, friends. This so-called \u201cBustards\u201d platter is made using a specific breed of   that inhabited the swamps of   immediately to the northeast of the village. Furthermore, all vegetables and herbs used in this recipe are swamp-growing species of plants found only there. But fear not my adventurous readers, I will attempt to find the best substitution and adapt the concoction so even a \u201cvegetarian\u201d   could make it.\n Let\u2019s start with the  . A single quail would be enough for a person, and two will make a good meal for a loving couple. I saw the cooks chopping quail heads and feet off but skipping plucking the feathers; instead, the birds were smothered and plastered in the swamp   of notably grey color. These clay-covered birds were then tossed in a blazing oven until the crust hardened. Then, an impressive culinary feat took place when a large woman, possibly with some   blood in her veins, cracked the clay shell with a single punch. This was my queue not to get caught trespassing again, but I digress\u2026\n The clay method is a way to pluck the bird in one go. If you are like me, you have access to birds that have already been prepared to be cooked. Be sure to tip your butcher well, as my mother always used to say. Words to live by. From here, my version of the recipe deviates from the Maid's. I implore you to remember to pepper the outside and inside of the bird. In the cavity, put a handful of swamp   to flavor the beast -  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , or even   could work. Take the twine and tie up the bird\u2019s wings close to the body and legs crossed to seal its filled cavity. Pat the animal dry.\n Turn a greased pan or skillet to high heat and quickly brown the quail all around until a gently appetizing golden color appears. Now you need to make a mixture of salt and   with the consistency of wet sand. Save the yolk for later! Plaster the fried bird with the mix as tight as you can and place it on a cooking dish, and roast it in a very hot oven for 20-25 minutes (it usually is much quicker, but the salt crust needs time to harden and seal all the juices).\n While the birds are being cooked, trim your   (asparagus) and  . If you are not in the  , you can source your swamp shoots from   communities as they adore herb-steamed greenneedles. You can also find them in Cormyr or brought from the village of   in the  . Throw greenneedle trimmings and cabbage core into a pot of water or stock you\u2019ve prepared ahead of time or \u201cborrowed\u201d from an inn. Be generous with the stock-making. Feel free to add  , ginger, other vegetables,   stems, or leftover trimmings you have. Cook it all together on medium flame. Make sure it is not in a rolling boil, or you\u2019ll end up with a murky stock.\n Thirty minutes later, strain the stock and toss the cooking vegetables. Now it\u2019s a good time to take out your birds and let the crust cook before handling. Boil the strained stock, reducing it to focus its flavor. In a separate pan, brown greenneedle stalks and shredded cabbage. You can use    , but I prefer sticking to poultry flavors, unlike what cooks at the Maid do. Now pat and drain fat from the cooked vegetables with paper or cloth. Use the same skillet (you might want to add a bit more fat and melt it), season with salt and pepper, add flour to make a sand-like thickener, and cook the taste of flour out until it turns golden. Now you need to be careful; control the heat of the saucepan by taking off and returning it to head as you slowly ladle in some of the stock and mix it well with the thickener. Do not forget to taste! TASTE! TASTE! Slowly start beating the egg yolks you had from earlier into the concoction. Mix vigorously, and make sure you don\u2019t make   instead of sauce. Continue adding the stock in until the sauce is a pale color and silky smooth.\n Now that the bird is cool, take out your best  , a  , or a   friend, and crack the salt shell open. Dust the bird off leftover salt and put it in the quail into the stock. Add greenneedle and whatever else you are serving and heat the dish through, keep the bird in the liquid in a low-heat oven if you need to keep it warm for later serving.\n Now, as to how to serve the dish. Take the quail out of the pot and place it into a tall but flat-bottomed serving dish. Pour the stock about halfway up the dish. Surround the soup with cooked swamp greenneedles and cabbage, and pour the silky gravy atop the dead beast. And sprinkle chopped herbs on it. And there it is, my version of \u201cBustards\u201d from Mornbryn's Shield.\n Alternatively, you can slowly cook the bird in the soup or make a sauce first and cook the meat in its silky goodness. However, that dish would be a bit lacking in presentation but still delicious. And as always, taste everything every step of the way and balance the flavor with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of   juice.\n And here we are, friends. I will need to dig through my notes and see what other dishes of note there were in the village of Mornbryn's Shield. But we might take a trip to the hot and humid   for a popular sweet dish.\n As always,  , and until we meet again.\nYours truly, Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good tidings, my friends. This  , we are traveling to a far-away continent for the first time since our stop for a bowl of stew in  . Today, we will be manhandling  , mixing   meat filling, seasoning, and cooking  , and as a side, we will make a quick salad of   beans served in the  . Yes, the City of Brass on the  , which has many connections to the lands of exotic  .\n This particular dish is called  . I first tasted it in the  , where my travel companions entertained a curious old   with her favorite dishes of stuffed  -filled onions, spiced salad, and baked    . As I can't get battan halfway across  , we are going to focus on onions!\n Stuffed onions:\n Let us begin with the fun part: preparing onions and spilling some tears in the process. Peel the onions and slice off the root part, leaving enough to keep the bulb together and make the cut flat so it can stay upright while cooking. Slice the top off with enough opening to be able to work with the onions' insides. Using a thin spoon, scoop out the insides from all four onions, but be careful. You need to leave enough onion shells to remain structurally sound. Reserve the scooped onions and chop them up.\n Fill a pot with enough water to cover the onions. Once the water is boiling, submerge the onion shells and cook them for between ten and 15 minutes, depending on the size. We are aiming for the onions to be cooked and soft but still holding their shape. Now drain and let them cool. Meanwhile, cook the chopped onions scoops on a skilled with one tablespoon of butter until softened and become sweet. In another pot, put all of your washed rice and cover with water about one phalange over the amount of rice. Optionally, use the onion boiling water for cooking rice or vegetable stock; add a sprinkle of salt, the remnants of your butter, one tablespoon of Za'atar seasoning, and one teaspoon of  . Cook on low until all the water is gone and absorbed into a fluffy well, cooked rice.\n Now we are going to make the filling. Mix together minced lamb, one tankard of cooked rice (reserve the rest for plating and a side),  ,   crumbs,   ,  ,  , half a tankard of cooked chopped onion, heavy cream, two tablespoons of Za'atar seasoning,  , crushed aleppo  ,  , one teaspoon of ground black pepper, and one teaspoon of  . Make sure you mix the stuffing well so the spices are evenly spread throughout. \n Onion caps (optional):\n Melt a tiny bit of   and brush the insides of the cooled onion shells. Place the spell in your palm and gently cup it. With the other hand, rub salt and pepper on the insides and start filling them up with the meat mixture. Gently press it around and fill the shells completely. Mix the ingredients for the onion caps. Form them into lids and press them on top of the stuffed onions.\n Braising liquid:\n Place your assembled onions into a deep baking dish. Brush the onions' surface with melted butter and add the braising liquid to the dish. Add a   and two crushed cloves of  . Cover and bake in a preheated oven at 375F. This is a short braise. Dolmat will be ready in about fifteen to twenty minutes. Check the internal temperature of the filling, and if it is at least 135F, you are ready to take them out.\n Spicy bean salad:\n Dressing:\n For this easy salad, drain and wash all your canned ingredients. While they are drying off, chop up the herbs, red  ,  , black  , and puree garlic. Preferably, keep all the salad's ingredients chilled. Mix the vegetables and beans together and make the dressing of  ,   juice, and hot   paste. Whip or blend them all together. Remember not to use extra virgin olive oil, or it will become bitter. Before serving, add the entire bowl of dressing to the salad and mix once again.\n Now to plate. Take some of the leftover yellow rice and place it on the plate in a ring or a puck. Place the stuffed onion right on top in the middle. Serve the salad in a side bowl. And we're ready to eat.\n Dolmat is a simple dish despite its large number of ingredients. We always forget that onion can be cooked by itself and even baked, and not just used in the northern   or chopped into soups, stews, and sauces. Zakharan cuisine reminds us of the humble onion being more than we think it could be. It is poetic in a sense. And the salad, when served chilled, feels like a wave of refreshing cool heat in your mouth, unexpectedly refreshing for something that comes from the land of   and  .\n I am unsure of what we are making next but the ready recipe is going to be one for    . And until then,   my friends.\n Yours truly, Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Any Dalesfolk could tell you of elven food and drink. Much of it is made with creatures of the forest that some   might find unpalatable, and many  , berries, fruits,  , bark, and   found in their woods. However, elven food from   is different. Once upon a time, Myth Drannan cuisine was typical for the  , mushroom this and mushroom that, but with the city's goods opening to other peoples and races changed that. An influx of  ,  ,  , and even   turned the great elven city into a melting pot, despite some elves' best attempts.\n This pumpkin soup is not as thick as soups you might find in   or  . It is also flavored with things you can find growing in Cormanthor. Notably, it is heavy on  . Wild   were roasted, sweetened with wild  , and reinforced with  ,  , and   mushrooms.\n Soup (2 servings):\n We will begin by cutting the pumpkin in two and scooping all of the seeds and fibers from its center. You can reserve the seeds to roast them later. Brush the insides and rims with cooking   and sprinkle with   and  . Place them on a sheet pan or baking dish cut side down. Bake in a preheated oven to 400F for about 20 minutes. When you can pierce the pumpkin with ease \u2013 it's ready. Take it out and let it cool.\n As it cools, dice the   and  . Smaller cubes mean they will cook quicker, and uniformity will cook them evenly. Cook them on low heat in a splash of neutral cooking oil and a small spoonful of butter. Let them soften for at least 20 minutes. When you press the carrots down with a spoon, and they are soft and mashable \u2013 take off the heat. Alternatively, you can boil the carrots to make them into a mash.\n The next step is to activate your dry  . Place them on a dry frying pan on medium flame, regularly swirling and tossing them about. We want to wake up the flavor of every single grain of spice. When your spices start to release fragrant steam, toss them on the same flame for 30 more seconds and remove from the heat.\n The next step is simple. Scoop the pumpkin out of the skin with a spoon and transfer its flesh into a cooking pot. Add your spices,  , sliced or minced fresh  , sliced  , cubed and peeled half of a green  . Add two cups of  . There should be enough to cover all ingredients, but depending on the pumpkin's size, you can add more stock or water.\n Bring the liquid to a boil, cover, and cook on low for 18-20 minutes or until all vegetables and soft and mushy. Remove the bay and push the entire soup through a fine sieve or blend it all. Now add honey and salt. Mix well, taste, and adjust the flavor. Honey is necessary to bring out pumpkin's flavor as much as salt is. I settled on about two small spoons of salt and half a cup of honey. Now, you can reduce the soup to the desired thickness. Add heavy cream before serving, and stir it well. Taste and adjust the flavor once again.\n Ladle the soup and add about a tablespoon of cream to the plate to make presentable white swirls. I served the soup with a small mound of fried mushroom chips and   sprigs. Underneath the bowl, I placed a   with crusty baked-on  .\n This soup can be kept in a chilled place for 3-4 days and can freeze well. You can substitute cream for   milk, and if you like your soup thick, you can decorate it with mushroom duxelles, carrot mash, and other types of crisped vegetables.\n Perfect for the season and goes well with a large tankard of spiked   or red  . This is the elfin pumpkin soup from Myth Drannor, or at least my version of it. Don't get your elfy knickers in a twist trying to correct the ingredients. Sometimes, things are hard to find outside of the Dalelands, Cormanthor, or even  .\n Next  , we will continue on with elven food, and it will either be a rice dish or something a carnivore would like.\n , my dears, and until we cook again.\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good tidings, my friends. It has been almost a   since our last attempt at cooking, hasn't it? I've missed you dearly, and it took me almost a tenday to clean a pileup of dishes, utensils, containers, and other dangerous cooking implements in the kitchen, and it's time to make another mountain of dishes to conquer.\n Today, as I've promised you, we are going to a quaint freezing town of    in the  . A simple mining town with simple food and today's meal will take time to make but minimal effort. The local specialty dish is freshly caught in frigid water  , steamed with a sauce of   and  . If you visit one of the several Fireshearan inns, you can often see a huge vat of steaming liquid puffing and huffing over a large half-carcass of salmon, sometimes bigger than yours truly! Even in its great size, salmon cooks quickly, and guests are free to come over to the pot to receive a handful of steamed fish dolloped with cream and shallot sauce. We will replicate the recipe on a smaller scale of just two portions of a smaller farm-raised salmon from the hatcheries in  . I heard that their fish is spawned by a  . Poppycock, if you ask me... Let's begin!\n Marinated carrots: \n I will serve the fish atop a bed of roasted  ,  , and  . Carrots take a long while to roast, and we would want them to be soft, so we are going to marinate them overnight. For the marinade, we will mix vinegar, olive oil, brown sugar, ginger, hot smoky peppers, paprika, ground cinnamon, cumin, fennel, coriander, salt, and black pepper. Mix it all together, cut carrots into smaller pieces, and submerge overnight.\n Smashed potatoes:\n Making potatoes is quick. I picked small-sized tubers and boiled them in a vat of water until they were soft enough to be pierced with a knife. Drain and let air dry. When dry, place them on a baking sheet, well-greased, and crush each with a fork. Add your mushrooms and carrots to the crushed potatoes and generously drizzle them with a mix of melted butter and oil. Season with salt and pepper and toss some chopped  . Roast on medium-high fire until the potatoes are crispy and the carrots are soft. \n Shallot and wine cream sauce:\n For the sauce, cube a shallot and cook it in a bit of butter or oil until soft; add a tankard of white wine and cook until reduced to ten percent of the original volume. I used a refreshing white wine from  , but as long as it's white and acidic, it will turn out well. Season with salt and pepper. Take it off the heat and add the cream just enough to change the color, and put it back on the low heat. Do not overheat the sauce, or it will break! Add several pinches of flour as a thickener and cook regularly, stirring until it thickens. Finish it was a small dollop of butter, and stir it into the sauce before serving.\n Steamed salmon: \n Steaming with be lightning swift if you youse a small portion of salmon, so be mindful, and the fish will continue to cook after you take it off steam. Make steaming liquid using remnants of your wine and add chopped shallots, crushed   cloves,  , and dill stems that you should have leftover from earlier. Place your salmon with skin on, skin side down on  , and generously salt it with sea salt and pepper to taste and toss lemon on top. Bring the steaming liquid to a rolling boil and place the fish to steam. Seven minutes should be all you need, and it will continue cooking as you're plating.\nPlace your roasted vegetables on the bottom of the serving dish, top them with salmon and pour your sauce over them. I added some simply cooked arugula to make sure I got some greenery in my meal. Serve with sprinkled or placed sprigs of dill.\n And there it is. Cuisine from that far north is known for its simplicity and blandness, but the taste of perfectly cooked salmon is silky smooth as is, and it doesnt really need anything else to make it palatable. It's almost as good as salmon pie from the Frozenfar, but that is for another day.\n The next dish we will tackle is a soup from the City of Splendors itself, made with roasted nuts and served with cheese and toasted bread.\n As a certain old mage once said, \"Life has no meaning but what we give it. I wish a few more of ye would give it a little.\" the meaning I give mine \u2013 is you, my dear friends. Until the next adventure.\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, my friends. It has been ages since last we talked, it seems. This  's dish is going to bring us all the way back to the frozen north of  \u2014the region known as the  . The town of   brought us a delectable and creamy   dish, but a comforting stew we simply call   is a regional staple you can try across the villages of Frozenfar, in the  , and even in the cities of  , such as   and  , the Jewel of the North.   can be a rare treat, owing to the nut trees being found mostly in the north and the fact that the nuts do not last. Even the freshest chestnuts you can purchase from   or from one of her fabulous emporiums are going to be roasted and boiled, then sealed away for freshness. For us, it is quite beneficial; it saves us time in bringing out the nuts' sweet flavor and tender texture. The other major ingredient here is lentils\u2014red, for their light sweetness. Typically, the stew is thickened with tubers and carrots, but we are going to use more preserved ingredients purchased from  : dried mushrooms of various types, which will imitate a fall version of the stew, made with freshly foraged northern fungi\u2014a recipe that became strangely popular in Neverwinter just half-a-decade ago.\n The soup's presentation and plating are done in a simple type of hard bread, cooked into a bowl-shaped loaf that is then emptied and used as a soup receptacle. In cheaper establishments, these crust bowls are reused endlessly, until they are chopped and tossed into other dishes. Eateries of a bit more finesse offer bowls to be cracked and dipped into the stew as you eat and leftovers are tossed to the  . But this entire recipe can be easily replicated in your kitchen; even some of the least equipped cooks can master it, as long as they can get their hands on quality chestnuts. Shall we begin?\n Bread Bowls\n Makes four large bowls:\n This bread variety needs to be crusty and tough to keep the stew without making any mess. Begin by mixing dry ingredients together. If you are making the bread a day or more ahead \u2013 we will go in dry. If the same day baking \u2013 we will bloom the yeast with sugar and lukewarm water. Break one egg into lukewarm water and, whisk it to break and mix them all. Gradually add liquid components into the dry and work them to incorporate. The dough should be kneaded for eight to ten minutes. Lightly grease the surface with some olive or vegetable oil and let it rest in a warm place for an hour. If you're making ahead \u2013 let it rise in the cold box for at least twelve hours.\n By now, the dough would've doubled in size. Gently unstick it from the bowl, split the dough im four buns, and roll each one until the dough is perfectly spherical. Don't worry, the dough will flatten a bit as it rests again and will grow a bit as well. Sprinkle some semolina or pumpernickel flour on the baking sheet to keep the bread from getting stuck. Make sure your dough rolls do not have visible seals. Gently transfer the dough balls onto a baking sheet, cover with a towel and let it be for about thirty minutes until it gets puffy.\n Preheat the oven to 400F. Before baking, brush the buns with eggwash and top with shredded parmesan cheese. If you like the cheese-less crusty, top the buns about halfway or fifteen minutes through baking. It would also make a good time for a second eggwash eggbrush. Depending on the oven, it might take a bit longer to bake thoroughly. The bread is ready to be taken out when a hard crust forms. Another way to test the bread for readiness, flip it over and tap the bottom; it should be dry and, when tapping, should sound a bit hollow.\n Let the bread cool completely before carving. Slice the loaves' tops, about 3/4  of an inch, and set aside. We will use the toppers as covers. Using a deep spoon or a lemon baller, scoop the soft bread from inside. Do not push hard, or the shell will crack, or you will push through, making the bowl unusable. Don't throw the scooped bread away; instead, blast it in a food processor and save it to use in another recipe or even to use as a thickener in this one.\n Chestnut Stew\n Makes four servings:\n We will begin by boiling a cup of water and pouring it over the dried mushrooms to rehydrate them. Once the water is cool, strain the mushrooms and wash them in cold water to remove dirt, earth, and grit. Next, we will finely dice onions, celery, garlic, and carrots. On medium-low heat, cook the diced vegetables in a drizzle of oil in a soup pot, regularly stirring them, with two leaves of   added in for flavor. We want them to soften, but if you accidentally let them get a bit of color \u2013 it is fine as long as you do not burn the pot! By now, the mushrooms would be a bit drier and ready to be tossed in the pot with vegetables. Chopping the mushrooms is optional. Cook the mushrooms with the vegetables with an optional spoonful of butter added if the pot looks too dry. The mushrooms won't change color much, but continue cooking them, making sure they do not burn.\n Now add stock, spices, and dried red lentils to the mix. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat to simmer, and cook covered for twenty-five to thirty minutes until the lentils soften. Add a spoonful of balsamic   and stir it in. Make sure the thickness is to your liking. The stew can be very thick, almost like porridge, or slightly watery. If you want to reduce the thickness, add another half a cup of chicken stock or water. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Lastly, add white or halved chestnuts to the stew and stir them in. Cover and cook on low simmer for fine minutes. It is fine to cook longer, but pre-cooked chestnuts are very soft and would crumble.\n Lastly, spoon the stew into the bread bowls, and while the stew is still piping hot, top it with parsley or gruyere cheese. Bring to the table covered with the bread top and remove and garnish in front of the guests. A light spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or a   smetana would go well with the stew, but just cheese bread for dipping would be a treat too. Serve with a mug of light   from the   with the meal.\n And this is all we made with a container of imported chestnuts I picked up from  . What can we make next? Maybe something with  , which we have leftover from the other chestnut recipe. Until then,   friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, dear readers, or if you're returning, hello again, my friends! Today, we are traveling to the place I hold dear to my tiny heart.  , the land of hospitality, fruits, spice, pranks, and    , in my language, means good food, but surprisingly enough,   foods are not very common outside of our southern home. One food that does appear on occasion in other hin-inhabited lands is a certain fruity, sweet, spicy, and savory sauce.\n This sauce is  . There are countless recipes that have regional and family variants. Ive known some halflings to start fisticuffs over whose harelveauplum sauce is better or more authentic. The recipe I am here to present this   is of my own creation. It involves hot  ,  ,   (or   if you don't have access to southern exports), along with a few other things.\n Harelveauplum sauce is used to make a thick spicy jam to spread over your thick buns, to make a dipping and drizzling condiment, and, of course, to marinade meats in and to make a thick sticky glaze with. As an example of what you can do with all that sauce you make with me, today we will marinade and then roast   ribs that we will serve with caramelized  . This entry in the cookery book will likely be long, so let us begin with the sauce itself.\n Harelveauplum sauce:\n Optional:\n Peel kiwis, pit plums, and seed the sweet  . Remove seeds from jalape\u00f1os and habaneros and reserve them to control how much extra heat you want for your sauce. Roughly dice all the ingredients and add them to the pot. Make a small bundle using butcher's twine and cheesecloth, fill it with black  , dried  , a  , and whoever much of the hot pepper seeds you want. Make sure the bundle is tied well so we can keep the sauce thickened with fruit pulp and not filled with dry and hard bits. Fill the pot with enough water to cover and an additional inch above all the chopped ingredients and add the tied-up   bundle. Turn the heat to high and bring to the boil. Add in the sugar and whisk it all in to dissolve. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer or slow boil and keep cooking it for at least two hours. Note that if the plums and kiwis you have are not sweet and fruity enough, you can add two cans of pitted plums in syrup, with the syrup, or boil a cup full of prunes with hot water and then blend them together and add to the sauce pot.\n Add hot water to the pot if you feel it is starting to evaporate. When the contents of the pot look like a fibrous fruit soup, blend it all together or push it through a fine sieve. Continue cooking and 15 minutes more. Taste the sauce and make sure it's acidic enough, sweet enough, and fruity enough. When you are satisfied with the taste, continue to cook uncovered until the mix is reduced to about two and a half quarts of sauce. Then, take off the heat and cover to chill. It will take hours to cool down, so feel free to chill overnight before jarring it for future use. Once it is chilled overnight, you will end up with a glossy, thick condiment that has sweetness, heat, and fruitiness. If you feel that your sauce is too watery and you don't feel like cooking it more, use arrowroot starch.\n Candied sweet potatoes:\n As a side, we will cook up some starchy   or even yams, dripped in  ,  , and  . This side dish is very easy to make, and you should start working on it before you are ready to bake the lamb. Fill up a pot with water. Pierce your sweet potatoes all around with a fork and boil them for 30 to 40 minutes. You will know it's time to take them out and cool once you test their hardness. A fork or a knife would go in with ease but still have a tiny bit of resistance.\n The next step is to cool the potatoes and peel them. Slice them into disks and line them at an angle on a greased-up baking dish. Melt the butter and mix it with sugar and molasses. Brush all the potato medallions with the mix, and be generous. Bake them in a preheated oven at 450F for about 30 minutes until caramelized and butter-soft. Every 6 minutes or so, brush the taters with the rest of the butter mix and sprinkle more brown sugar atop. When it's ready, your potatoes will be coated in a sweet, sugary glaze, and brown sugar butter mix at the bottom of the pan can be used to dip sweet     in. As a matter of fact, we will serve drip-dipped coconut bread with the dish!\n Lamb's ribs:\n First thing first, we will need to spend some time cleaning up the ribs. Make sure your butcher's knife is very sharp. Trim the excess fat from both sides of the rack and slice all visible silverskins. Gently separate each rib into a separate \"popsicle.\" and drizzle both sides of each with salt and pepper.\n Transfer a mug of harelveauplum sauce into a mixing bowl and add   as well as two crushed cloves of garlic. Using a whisk, mix in sugar and oil until well incorporated. If your sauce doesnt have that slight acidity, add a tablespoon of lemon or lime juice. Submerge lamb ribs fully and let marinate overnight in a chilled place for at least 4 hours.\n We will be baking them in a preheated oven at 350F and finishing up at 500F or under a broil. Grease a baking dish and line it with ribs. Generously spoon the sweet and hot marinade over them. We will be baking them for 40 minutes with stops to flip them and add more marinade on top every ten minutes. When cooked \u2013 turn the heat to the max and sear the sugary sauce on both sides to turn it to glaze. Each side should not take more than 3 minutes.\n Now, all we need is to plate. Pile your sweet potatoes on one side of the dish and lamb on the other. Add some sliced basil leaves for a splash of color. Add a bowl of harelveauplum sauce on the side to dip and soak some coconut bread in sugar and butter drippings.\n This is what I call \"taste of home.\" You might think there is too much sweetness on a plate, but that is what we halflings like. And the sauce itself has more fruitiness and acidity that gives the food a certain freshness. My aunt Horateena Stumbletoes liked to drizzle this dish with a squeeze of lime. I am not sure I approve of this, but to each their own.\n Of course, you will need to wash it all down with a big portion of shopped fruit salad in cream and a tankard of  !\n That is all I have for you, my friends. I hope this dish entertained you and showed you a bit of what hin culture is like.\n I have not decided what we will do next tenday, but I am sure it will be fun! So long, and until the next time,  \n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n After a bit of a break \u2013 we are returning to cooking and going back to the distant land of  . The cuisines found in that continent and its islands are different from what many of us are used to on the  ; much of the dishes are sweetened with   and   and foods are accompanied by spiced rice and savory, spicy, and sweet sauces. Even meats and roast are often flavored with sweet spices \u2013 no wonder Zakharan food is beloved in the   and especially among the   of  , who learned to incorporate similar flavors into their cuisine. Today's dish is an entire meal for two or even four, but in Zakhara, a single     is a portion for one at a Sheikh's feast, nestled atop a sticky mound of Coconut Rice. And I should mention that if you dont fancy coconut, a serving of  ,  , and spiced rice.\n This particular recipe is an adaptation from a feast once held by Sheikh   of   during his venture into the   in the  . Hiz feast, even when away from the palace, was unending, like it is customary in Zakhara. Unlike what we consider dining in  , Zakharan tradition is not centered around a smallbite-to-main-course-to-dessert. Instead, foods are served in big communal dishes brought out by servants seemingly at random. But making such a feast at a small   kitchen would be a nightmare, so I am going to focus on a single fowl and enough rice to feed between two halflings and four  . Shall we begin?\n Honeyed Chicken\n Makes four servings:\n Begin by preparing a young chicken. To reduce a mess, dry the skin off as well as the cavity using paper towels. Chop off any flapping pieces of skin and fat and remove one joint from each wing. Do not throw the wings away, save them along with giblets to make a stock with later. Place the chicken in a large bowl to contain all dripping juices, and generously sprinkle the cavity with salt and freshly ground pepper. Do the same with the entirety of the chicken. It should take about two tablespoons of salt overall. Leave the chicken uncovered in cold storage overnight. The salt will brine the meat and dry the skin. The next day you will notice the salt is completely gone.\n Once again, dry off the chicken skin completely as well as the cavity. Using a butcher's twine, truss the chicken, affixing legs and wings in place. The first step will be searing the chicken on all sides. Preheat a skillet on high heat with some cooking oil. Once hot, place the chicken breasts down and let it crispen. Continue turning the chicken around, spending about two to three minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the heat and position it on a roasting rack. Remove the fat from the frying pan and deglaze any fond with a bit of stock.\n Once cooled enough to handle, take a handful of cinnamon and dub it into the insides of the chicken's cavity. Stuff two dried     in there, along with half a  , two large smashed cloves of  , about one spoonful of fresh  , three  , and  . Smother the chicken skin generously with hot red pepper paste and let it marinade the chicken for thirty minutes more while you work on the rest of the recipe. Once the paste noticeably dried off a bit, spoon honey over to cover the entire chicken. Do not use all of the honey listed in the recipe; you will need the rest.\n Fill the bottom of the roasting pan with chicken stock, white  ,  , and cover the chicken and the pan with tinfoil to begin the roasting with steaming. Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the chicken to cook covered for 30 minutes. Twenty minutes in, remove the cover and base the chicken with the basting liquid first and then spoon more honey over gently rubbing it over the skin with a spoon. Cover again and cook for ten minutes more. Ten minutes later, remove the cover and baste with basting liquid and honey. Keep the cover removed, but do not throw the tin foil away (you might need it later to stop the skin from darkening too much). Baste the chicken with more honey and continue baking for 15 more minutes. Baste with honey and liquid again. While you are at it, check the internal temperature. Cooking times differ depending on the chicken size, and the oven to the roasting itself might take much longer \u2013 we will take the chicken's internal temperature by sticking the thermometer's needle in the spot between the leg and the body. We are looking for 165F, but a few degrees lower is fine, as it will continue cooking when removed from the oven. Continue baking, basting, and checking the temperature. If you notice the legs or breasts are getting too dark, cover them with tinfoil to continue baking.\n When the thermometer reaches the internal temperature that is safe to eat, transfer the chicken to a wire rack and let it cool a bit before portioning it. You can turn the basting liquid into a gravy or sauce if you want by reducing it in a pan and adding butter and flour as well as more seasoning to taste. A good serving would include a leg and a breast. Now, to make the rice.\n Spiced Coconut Rice\n Makes four servings:\n Begin by washing the rice. It will take several washes until the water is clear. The rice will be sticky enough and there is no need to have additional starch in the dish. Once the water is clear, soak the rice in cold water for 30 minutes.\n Drain the rice, transfer it into a cooking pot, and cover with a can-full of coconut milk. Turn the heat up, and while the milk is heating up, stir all the other ingredients in. Once the milk is bubbling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for twenty minutes. Remove the cover and turn the heat up just a bit. If there is still too much liquid in, let it cook more, regularly stirring. The very gentle light browning will begin in the rice and coconut milk. The side dish is ready once the rice is soft and has no bite, but you can continue cooking, regularly stirring at a higher heat - medium-low flames, to darken the coconut milk. The caramelization will only make it taste better.\n Once the rice is ready, add about two spoonfuls per large serving or one per small serving. Top the rice with quartered chicken and sliced chicken breast. Don't forget to remove the wishing bone from the breasts first to make the service easier. You can garnish it with any leftover coconut flakes and orange-grated zest, as well as orange slices.\n Typically, this chicken dish and the rice both have spice and sweetness, but the   it is served with adds even more sweetness to the palate. I personally like serving it with a mug of red or     or a strong serving of spiced  .\n A simple recipe that requires quite some time to be thoroughly cooked and an attentive cook. This is all I have for you this  . Next time \u2013 wine!\n  my friends, and until the next time we cook.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This   I have a special treat for you. Straight from our bearded sout friends in the  .   is a popular food among   and communities close to the dwarven settlements. Leek bread and potato and leek soup are one of dwarven staples found virtually everywhere dwarves are. Most commonly, leek breads is often served in hand-sized rolls as a side accompaniment to soups or   back steak, and we will get to roth\u00e9 cooking sometime soon. I was made this exact meal we will cook tonight when I visited   several winders back. A lovely dwarvish eatery there served me a big bun filled with leeks and cheese and a huge bowl of soup that I couldn't even finish. The type of ale they served, thick and acidic, was a nice addition.\n Dough:\n Now let's talk about making this hearty meal. As before, you can make the dough ahead. Take a single tankard of warm   (  milk for authenticity and that slightly herbal acidic taste) and add a single spoonful of   and a spoon of sugar. Mix and let the yeast do its stinky magic. When the milk is frothy with yeast foam, beat a single   and mix it in. This recipe will need about three tankards of  . Start adding it in through a sieve one tankard at a time. (If you want to follow my personal favorite recipe, add three heaping spoons of dried and ground  ) Mix well, adding salt and pepper to taste. A pinch of each should suffice. Knead the dough until it's not lumpy anymore, about five minutes. Cover and let it rest in a warm place for at least an hour until the dough is doubled in size. If you are refrigerating it overnight, take the dough out and allow it to rise a bit more \u2013 two hours or so before baking.\n Soup: \n Now leeks. Clean your leaks well; the vegetable is always filled with soil and sand. Cut the green part off and toss it into a large pot. I recommend you use five small leeks of large ones. The white part - slice them into either ribbons or small cubes. Set aside. Use the greens to make vegetable stock, which we've talked about several times before. Cook it with  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .  Let it boil for at least 30 minutes and strain. Taste and season with spices and salt and continue simmering down and reducing the liquid to concentrate the flavor. When reduced, add cubed potatoes and a white part of the leeks. I used four small leeks and three potatoes for this part. Add two cloves of chopped garlic, a  ,  a handful of  , and salt and pepper to taste. You will need to cook all these things together on simmer until the potatoes are soft. It will take about 45 minutes but do not be afraid to overcook it. Do not cover the soup; you will need to evaporate the liquid so your soup is thick. Mash and blend the soup together with half a tankard of   (add more if needed), but not before you remove the bay leaf and thyme sprigs out. Transfer back into the pot.\n Filling:\n Now let us make bread stuffing. Chop up a pale portion of 3 leeks and toss them onto a skillet with  , three sprigs of chives of spring onions, and two finely minced cloves of garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook in butter on low heat until the leeks are soft and sweet. This might take an hour or more. When cooked, set 1/3 aside. We will add it to the soup before serving.\n Transfer cooked leeks into a mixing bowl. Add four fresh mashed cloves of garlic, half a tankard of hard crumbly cheese, grated, and half a tankard of soft, sharp cheese (if mozzarella, go for dry, but feel free to add more!). Break a single egg in and a generous amount of dried or finely chopped fresh  , and add a small sprinkle of breadcrumbs soaked in milk. Sprinkle with salt and fresh pepper and mix until well distributed.\n Now to shape the dough. Separate the dough into balls the size of a human fist and start rolling it out. Smaller buns - use   fist as a measurement. Remember, the dough will puff up as you bake it. Preheat the oven to 350F. Scoop a generous amount of stuffing and place it at the center of the rolled dough. Pull the sides up to cover the stuffing and pinch it together to seal. Gently roll the bun around to hide the seams and make it look more even, and place it seam-side down on a baking sheet, greased beforehand. Repeat it until you use up all your stuffing. Use scissors or a sharp knife to make a V-shaped cut on the top to let the steam and liquids out as the bread bakes. Brush them with oil or butter and sprinkle with large salt crystals. Bake for 20 minutes, take out and rotate, and bake for 20 more. Once the buns are golden in color and have a hard crust - they are ready to come out and rest.\n \nLadle the soup into serving bowls, and two large spoons of cooked leeks you set aside earlier, sprinkle with hard, sharp cheese, parsley, and a light drizzle of acidic  . A single bowl and a single handbun per serving. Trust me; you will love this meal. Break the fresh bread apart and dunk it into the thick soup. Bliss. I think this is what  's blessing tastes like. The slight fresh spiciness of ginger goes great with the creamy soup.\n If you have dwarves from   for dinner or some friends from   \u2013 this is your go-to meal. Pair it with some fresh light wine or some  , and you will have some hushed whispers praising your skills the next day! \n That would be all this tenday, my friend. The next recipe will be from  , and I might have to re-do it once I conquer a dungeon or two to raise funds. Maybe I should ask   for a donation, of who am I kidding, that scoundrel would demand a credit... \n  and until next time,\nStay mindful, stay plump,\n Yours as always,\nJuniper Churlgo\n \n \n Ah, the tiny patchwork of a nation, the  . A collection of feuding city-states that claimed some of the most fertile land southeasts of the  . When the region is at peace, it's a glorious place to visit. Rolling green hills dotted with vineyards and ancient aqueducts. Mountain valleys. Fresh bread and flavorful   are pressed in the  .\n There is no better sight than seeing the first rays of the late summer sun hitting the lush mountain valleys of the Kingdoms or seeing the evening sun glistening off the  . Today's dish is from a less prosperous city of  , a humble coastal settlement of fishers and farmers that grew greatly following the infamous  .\n These tiny pots of Lomartan beans stuffed with  ,  , fresh vegetables, and local   sausages are baked en mass on the   and delivered across town. Some of the pots are lidded with clay tops, while others are wrapped in simple, tough dough to keep the steam and gorgeous aroma inside.\n This is a simple recipe, and dare I say, some of the best bean dishes I've tried so far. There are three parts for us to tackle. Firstly, we need to make simple dough with    , some  , a dash of water, and hard clear alcohol. Simply mix it all together and set it aside for when you are ready to bake.\n Vegetable base (makes 4 servings):\n Let's now prepare aromatic vegetables \u2013 a very common part of Blade Kingdomer cuisine. Finely cube sweet  ,  ,  , and   (I used red, but green is what is traditionally used). Add minced  , salt, pepper, and a   leaf, and slowly cook it all on a pan in a drizzle of olive oil. Use low heat to bring out the flavors and keep your oil fresh-tasting, regularly steering the vegetables. When softened, pour in a good white wine, like  . Stir and cook to evaporate the alcohol and reduce.\n Sausages (makes 4 servings):\n Now, the sausages. You can keep them in the casing, but I prefer to get my hands dirty. Local Blade Kingdomer sausages are made with pork, very fatty, and well-spiced with paprika, so you don't need to add much more to it. Add all the sausages taken out of their casings to a bowl, and add a dash of salt and pepper. I added some dried scallions and Herbes de Provence and/or savory leaves, dried as well. Mix the meat well and form it into small balls. Toss the meatballs into a hot skillet to brown on all sides. There is no need to add oil as sausage fat will quickly melt and make sure nothing gets stuck.\n Beans (makes 4 servings):\n When they are ready, toss them together with your vegetables, preserved or fresh beans (soaked overnight), and more   as well as  , dried or finely chopped. I used white beans. I am unsure what they use in Lomatra, but I went with butterbeans and pinto.\n Dough covers  (makes 4):\n Fill your clay pots with the mix you just prepared, topping it with a bay leaf and a single dried pequin pepper to give it light heat and a smoky taste. Add a drizzle of white wine and olive oil to each pot. Roll out your dough and seal the jars. Brush the crust with oil or melted butter if you want a bit more flavor in the crust.\n Place the jars into a hot oven for 45-50 minutes and have a glass of Saerloonian Topaz while you wait. And that is all there is, my friends. I paired a pot with an iced glass of   (which is half table wine and half slivovitz, by the way) and a salad of greens and yellow peppers coated in red wine vinegar, oil, and   dressing.\n I hope you try this dish for yourself and share its splendid simplicity with the fishers and commoners of Lomatra.\n , and until next time we meet, possibly in   or the plane pf  .\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n For those of you who like to singe your mouth and burn your guts with hot peppers, may I introduce you to a simple dish from the distant continent of  ?  ,  ,  , and   are the staples of the cuisine, at least in the   territory of  . I traveled there on an expedition once after finding stuffed   in a store in  . Long story short \u2013 a chubby friendly Payitlan woman invited me over to her home and, of course, cooked for me. She eagerly stirred her big   pot of beans, peppers, and tomatoes and shaped mayz mash into hand-sized cakes. Unfortunately, the language barrier meant I had to improvise and try making something that tasted as close to the stew from Maztica as possible. So, let us begin.\n Stew (15 servings):  \n First thing first, if you're using dried beans, and you probably are, soak them in cold water overnight. I used black and white (pinto), but I am unsure what the names of local Maztican species of legumes are, but I implore you to experiment. Prepare the spices: we will need a heap of  , a heap of ground white pepper, ground  ,  , crushed hot pepper flakes, crushed dried  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Additionally, I used a herb known as epazote.\n Now for the vegetables. You will need a handful of tomatoes and sweet peppers. I like roasting them first with a drizzle of oil to bring out the flavor. Roughly cut  ,  , hot peppers, and sweet peppers and all of them to a clay pot, along with roasted vegetables, spices, and drained soaked beans. I usually add a cup or so of bean water, along with stock (as always \"borrowed\" from the closest inn) and water. Cook uncovered on medium flame, regularly stirring. Add water when it evaporates. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and lemon juice if needed. Yes, it IS supposed to be hot. When I tried it for the first time, my face turned into a red, sweaty mess and the Maztican matron had a good laugh at my expanse.\n Mayzcakes:\n I have to admit I could not pinpoint the recipe's taste, so take this as a work in progress. Maztican mayzcakes are simply fried or baked flops the size of a hin's hand. They are made with ground mayz meal, hot peppers, fresh mayz, and that is all. My attempts to use just mayz resulted in hard and not particularly flavorful cakes, so I suggest making a mix of mayzmeal and regular flour, salt, sugar, crushed hot red peppers, chopped hot fresh green peppers, roughly chopped cilantro, fresh corn, two  , baking powder. Mix all the ingredients with water until the consistency of the wet and sticky dough is reached and let it rest in a chilled place.\n Mayzcakes are a versatile food in Maztica. They travel well and are used as travel rations. Their mouth-singeing heat makes you sweat like a hog, which in turn, cools you \u2013  -sent in Maztican heat. These cakes were wrapped in leaves to travel, which kept them soft. When eaten with Maztican bean stew, I like to dip them or crumble them into the dish. Another interesting use of mayzcakes \u2013 is morningfeast. Old cakes can be soaked in eggs and fried in a puddle of eggs. Then the egg was folded around the cake akin to an envelope and served for morningfeast.\n When you are ready to serve the stew, roast or fry cakes in a drizzle of oil and pile them on a plate. Caution, both dishes are VERY HOT! So unless you're a valorous eater (or a halfling) use caution and common sense.\n And another dish it recorded by yours truly. Next, we are going to the green   to hunt for some  .\n Until next tenday,\n , my friends.\n \n \n Today we will return to the coastal city of   in green  . Located at the very top of the  , this city was blessed by a visit from our friend, Master Traveler of the Realms,  . Velen and several of its eateries were written about in Volo's guide to the  . This particular dish was a highlight of his visit to the   called  . Imagine a platter of shapely battlements of molded  , dripping with butter and served with servings of several local meats, all in their own quarters of that rice castle.\n This dish is called  , and it is a long day of cooking for one halfling to handle, but it is doable if you're fearless in the kitchen. For the main structure of rice, you will need local Tethyrean  ,  , a drizzle of white  ,  , and  , or  . It will hold four quarters of separated foods. The first one will hold cooked and shredded   (or   in my case), drenched in white   and   sauce. The second one will hold   cooked in  ,   juice,  ,  , shallots, and a bit of  . Third - will hold cooked   or   sprinkled with bacon. And the last one \u2013 mushrooms drown-cooked in butter.\n Roasted chicken:\n We will begin with roasting a chicken. The Pride of Velen recipe for two eaters will require only a tankard of shredded meat and skin. Pat the animal dry and abundantly salt and pepper the skin, under the skin, and the cavity. Leave it uncovered in a chilled place overnight so the salt has time to flavor and tenderize the bird. Line the roasting pan with sliced celery, onions, and carrots, and toss chicken giblets onto the pan. Place the chicken on top. Stuff the cavity with aromatic herbs and plug the hole with half a lemon. I sued  , thyme,  , and parsley. Roast the animal in an oven, preheated to 400\u00b0F, and reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F once the chicken goes in. Roast for 40 minutes. Test the temperature in the bird's thigh \u2013 it should be at 160\u00b0F. For extra tenderness, baste the bird in butter or drippings every 15 minutes.\n Sauce:\n We will use the roasted chicken drippings and browned vegetables to make the white wine sauce. Deglaze the pan with a tankard of white wine and transfer everything into a skillet to cook and reduce the wine by approximately half. Add two finely minced cloves of garlic, one big spoonful of  , and a cup of stock. Cook them together until everything is reduced by half. Strain the liquid and transfer it to a clean pan. Continue reducing for fifteen more minutes. Add thickener - 1 tablespoon of butter, a tablespoon of flour, whisked together with a bit of hot broth. Mix it all and add finely chopped parsley. Thicken it all with a drizzle of heavy cream and set aside. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside and keep warm. We will pour it all over shredded chicken meat later.\n Wild rice:\n Wash your rice in cold water 2-3 times until the water runs clear. Add the cleaned rice to the cooking pot and cover with water; approximately one human phalange of water over the rice. Finely dice carrots, roughly the same size as rice grains, and add to the rice and water. Cover and turn the flames to high until the water boils, then immediately reduce the heat to low and slowly cook rice for about 15 minutes or until soft and fluffy, absorbing all water. When the rice is cooked, carefully drain it. Mix vinegar, sugar, mirin, and salt in a bowl until crystals are fully dissolved. Then pour the mix into the rice using a flat paddle utensil to mix and distribute it evenly. This will make the rice sticky and easy to shape. Cover it to keep it moist and warn before shaping it onto a platter.\n To cook asparagus, simply bring a pot of sea-water-like saltwater to boil. Add trimmed asparagus and cook for 2 minutes. Test for softness; a knife should go into a stalk easily but still retain a bit of resistance and crunch. Remove the stalks and cool them in ice-cold water to stop the cooking. Set aside. Bake bacon to crumble it over asparagus later and place slices of bacon on little pikes to form flags for the battlements of rice on the plate. Lastly, cook mushrooms whole in butter and a slight drizzle of white wine with salt and pepper until they are soft and buttery. It should take about 10 minutes, covered, depending on the mushrooms' size.\n Snails:\n Quickly cook the snails. Begin by dicing two small or one big shallot and cooking it in butter until soft and translucent. Add snails and cook together for 5 minutes on medium heat, constantly moving them in butter to cook evenly. Reduce the heat and add lemon juice, grated lemon peel, and brandy\u2014season with salt and pepper to taste. Usually, a 1/4 teaspoon sprinkle is enough. Cook for five more minutes on low heat. Add finely chopped herbs, and it's ready to serve.\n Butter up your hands and start shaping the rice. You can use a tankard or a glass to help with molding it all. Shape the tall middle tower, four smaller towers on the opposite sides of the fortress... I mean platter. Connect the towers to the central spire. Place flags into each tower. Next step - filling up the platter's quarters with cooked foods. Shredded chicken on one side, covered in white wine gravy. On the opposite side of the chicken - asparagus; drizzle it with melted butter, salt, and crumbled bacon. Place a lettuce leaf on the southern side of the dish and spoon snails in. Be generous with the sauce. Opposite of snails \u2013 place butter mushrooms. Sprinkle the platter with greens and drizzle the rice with hot, melted butter. And now \u2013 serve it to your guests.\n Each of these platters can feed two or three humans. Remember to have some refreshing ale with the dish.   is a good choice for its nutty flavor and uplifting aroma. It is made near Velen, in the town of  . The leftovers of this dish can be piled on a hot pan the next day to make great fried rice to have as a nourishing morningfeast.\n This one platter can be called a feast. Cooking it all did feel like I was making a feast for the Old Mage himself. So much work, but it is worth the effort. I am still deciding where we will go next tenday, but it likely will be closer to home than you think! \n Until next time, friends.   and never stop cooking!\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n This  's meal is a slight deviation from the norm for us. It is not really a single dish, but a thematic meal... A historic last meal. Queen Filfaeril Selazair Obarskyr, the Dragon Queen, the beloved wife of King  , famed for her stately affairs and being featured in a scandalous and popular smutty  ,  . She was a powerful woman, the leader of the Forest Kingdom of  , known for her intellect, alliance forging, and regal presence. Notably, she ran a secret network called the   that was tasked with serving and protecting Cormyr. Sadly, I never got to meet Queen Fee, nor did I ever come across her daughter,  , the Steel Regent of Cormyr. According to the royal archives, Queen Fee passed in the  , surrounded by friends, family, and confidants.\n Her passing was foreseen, expected, and yet sudden. Alusair,  , and   were present in the Queen's last moments, and, by some accounts, she was even visited by her beloved and long-dead husband, Azoun. The same account of the Queen's last moment also preserved information on her last meal: a simple serving of   broth,  ,  , and  . And in my attempts to honor this great historic woman, I am recreating her last meal. We are going to prepare a simple and comforting, gently   duck broth, with nothing but gently simmered duck meat and fresh greens\u2014a typical recipe from  's kitchens, taken directly from  , available from the great fortress-library of  . The   recipe is presented to you courtesy of   in  , the capital city of Cormyr. It might be different from the tarts made for Queen Fee, but the manuscript never went into such details, so I am willing to do some minor improvisation. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time making the broth, but the rest of the meal comes together quickly and easily for your guests. Shall we begin?\n Duck broth\n Makes four servings:\n Let's begin by preparing the duck. If you are using leftover carcass from a roast duck, you can skip this step and simply skip forward to the simmering step. But if you are doing what I have pictured with the recipe \u2013 using fresh duck legs and thighs, then we need to begin by rendering the fat, and that will take quite some time.\n Take a big soup pot, wide enough to easily fit both legs, and preheat it on medium flame. Using a sharp knife, score the skin on the duck legs. It will allow the fat to melt evenly. Score it criss-cross, making incisions at least half an inch distance. Place the duck skin side down into a hot pot and leave it there. Reduce the heat to medium-low and watch the fat melt. Do not burn the skin; just slowly render the fat, regularly pouring excess out and reserving it for future culinary uses. It might take up to 40 minutes, depending on the duck. You will know it's time to work on the broth once the layer of fat under the skin is noticeably reduced.\n Remove the legs from the pot and pour out the fat. Leave any darkened bits caked into the pot and about a spoonful of fat in. Next, slice an onion in two as well as a small chunk of ginger. Return the pot to medium flame and press sliced onions and ginger into the pot, allowing them to darken. Duck broth is dark in color, so there's no need to worry about keeping the vegetables and meats pale during the simmering step.\n Now it's time to assemble the broth for simmering. There is not need to peel  ,  , or  . Skin has flavor, and we will extract it all. Put all of the ingredients into the pot, including caramelized onions,  , and partially cooked duck. Cover with water or vegetable stock \u2013 it should be about three and a half to four quarts to cover. Bring the pot to a boil, reduce it to a simmer, partially cover, and let it gently bubble for at least three hours. I cooked the broth for six hours to ensure every bit of flavor was extracted.\n The next step should be quite familiar to you. We strain the broth, discarding spices and vegetables, but we reserve the duck legs. They are fully cooked and now tender and buttery enough to slide off the bone. Gently shred the meat and discard bones and skin. Cover the meat and reserve it for later.\n The worst part of this recipe and removing excess fat from the broth. My method is two-step: first, I leave the broth to cool in the ice box. It should be gelatinous enough to thicken, and the fat on the top will harden. Peel off the fat and discard it. Once the broth comes up to room temperature again, remove the rest of the fat by using a paper towel trick \u2013 rip paper towels into strips and drag them across the surface of the broth. The paper will absorb the fat. Clean the soup pot and transfer the broth back into it, along with shredded duck meat. Heat it up before serving. Do not forget to season it with some sea salt to taste.\n Shrimp tarts\n Makes six tarts:\n Begin by defrosting phyllo dough. We will need about twelve sheets to make six tarts. While they are getting warmed up and ready to work with, clean the  . Pull off the legs and shells and devein the shrimps. To devein, make an incision along the shrimp's back and pull the tiny black tube out.\n Roughly chop all the ingredients listed above: shrimp,  ,  , garlic, parsley, and add them to a food processor, along with eggwhite, fish sauce (or oyster sauce, or garum),  ,  , and  . Blast all of the ingredients together until they turn into a paste. Check for seasoning by frying off a little bit of the mixture.\n Prepare for baking the tarts. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Brush the cupcake tins with a light coat of butter or oil. Open the phyllo dough and begin working one sheet at a time while covering the rest with a lightly damp towel to stop the sheets from drying off and cracking. When I prepared my tarts, I went a bit too zealous on the butter, and it ended up pooling on the bottom of the tins, so thread the next step carefully. Brush each of the sheets with a small amount of melted butter or oil. Fold them thrice and line the bottom of the cupcake tin. Repeat with another sheet and place it folded over the previous piece, forming a cup. Crinkle the sides to make them more presentable. Repeat until you have all six ready to be filled.\n Now we will spoon two scoops of shrimp paste into the cups and gently press it into the mold. An additional idea to make them prettier is to slice a single shrimp in two and place it on top of a tart in an aesthetically pleasing manner.\n Bake the tarts for 14-15 minutes. You will know the cooking is done when the dough is browned and crumbly and the shrimp mixture is thickened. Remove the tarts from the tin and let them cool on the wire rack.\n To serve the meal, pour the broth into a bowl and do not forget to scoop a generous amount of duck meat into it. Serve tarts cooled and topped with some herbs or microgreens; both would also be good additions to the broth.\n Do not forget to have some crackers, grapes, and cheese ready to serve as the meal's last kiss.\n There we go, Queen Filfaeril Selazair Obarskyr's last meal as recorded by the Forest Kingdom's historians. Serve with a chalice of quality deep red  .\n This concludes the tenday's recipe. Next \u2013 we will travel to   for some baked goods, and make sweet rolls \u2013 oh so common across  .\n Godsspeed, my friends, and until the next tenday,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n  is a fish we have in abundance in   and the coastal areas of the  . More commonly known as bluefin, tuna is fished in the   as well as the  . Other species of bluefins can be found across  , but the northern cuisine has a very specific way of preparing the fish, different from what you can find, for example, in  , or  , or even in  . According to  , penned all the way in 1317 DR in  , seared bluefin was a natural evolution of a simple freshly caught fish, butchered and grilled on the rocks or slabs of iron, greased with some salted pig's belly slabs. The earliest account of this method of cooking tuna dates all the way to the ancient  . Eventually, the northern   were taught that fresh tuna is delectable and smooth like butter fresh. The teachers were the   who ate it raw. As a middle ground, the fish was then portioned into steaks, something that humans have been eating for millennia, and lightly seared to cook just the surface, leaving the middle red and succulent. Some claim that this method came from the hermitic community of aquatic elves living in the depths of  , but I find this claim dubious at best.\n The northern city, where seared tuna is most common, is the City of Skilled Hands,  , perhaps dating all the way back to when it was called Eigersstor. For an extra copper, your tuna steaks could be rolled in various crusts and cooked to order, simply sliced on the plate, sometimes doused in a  -based sauce. The dish from this   is known as Seared Tuna \u00e0 la Stronghold, or simply, Stronghold Tuna. Appropriately so, one can partake in that dish when visiting the Stronghold, just northeast of Neverwinter. Asking your chef to cook the steak through will likely result in you being banned from the eatery. This recipe calls for a yellowfin steak, flavourful pink peppercorns, and black peppercorns, both abundantly found in most pantries thanks to healthy exports from the southern jungle regions. The tuna is then sliced and served with a lemon wedge, sea salt, and butter-simmered creamy, waxy potatoes. A handful of herbs and a scoop of lemon sauce are optional. Shall we begin?\n Seared tuna\n Makes two servings:\n This recipe is short and sweet, but it will need to work that   of yours to crack the peppercorns down to be used as the crust. If you do not have a mortar, you can still make it by improvising. A small frying pan's bottom can be pushed down to crush peppercorns on a cutting board, even if it might be a bit messy with pits of pepper flying around. I've successfully cracked my peppercorns with the bottom of a saucepan in a large skillet.\n All you need to do with the cracked peppercorns is mix them: pink, black,   flakes, and fine  . I like mixing it all on a large plate big enough to fit the entire steak.\n First, tuna steaks need to be dried. Using paper towels, pat all sides of the steaks dry. Turn the heat up on a large skillet on medium or medium-high flames and lightly drizzle it lightly with oil for searing. Let the oil heat up until it ripples (do not let it smoke); you can test by dropping something in the oil or by dropping a droplet of water into the oil.\n Take the steaks and roll them in the pepper mixture to coat all sides evenly. Press the crust gently into the fish to avoid gaps. Have a timer ready. Place the coated steaks into the hot pan and time them. Sear them for a minute and a half or two minutes per side, and dont forget to sear the edges for about half the time. Don't worry if some of the coating falls off; it is fine, and probably because you used too much oil.\n Take the steaks off the pan and let them rest for a few minutes before cutting for service. You should have a nice red on the cross-section with a grayish ring of cooked flesh around it. Slice it and plate it on a bed of red  . Serve with a side of potatoes that I will quickly tell you how to cook next, and a piece of lemon to squeeze over the potatoes and the fish. A good thing to serve with it is some sea salt, as some diners might like to season the tuna more.\n For the potatoes, a side of lemon potatoes from the   platter recipe can be done, but waxy potatoes cooked in butter are similar. Simply cut two large waxy potatoes into large chunks, run them under cold water to wash off the starch, pat dry, and sear on one side in a preheated skillet in a light drizzle of oil. Once one side is browned, flip them over, reduce the heat to stop the butter from burning, and toss a dollop or two into the pan. You can add herbs to the butter, too. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover, and let them cook for 30-35 minutes or so. The potatoes are ready when they are soft and a toothpick goes in with no resistance.\n Despite the recipe's verbosity, it is very simple and can be a quick dinner if you have fresh bluefin on hand from the local fishmonger.\n And this concludes the tenday's recipe entry in  . The next recipe will be from  , and the recipe will be tested over the weekend. It is still to be decided...\n Untill then,  ,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Back to the  , we go for this  's dish. Commonly eaten by garrisons and cooked in huge vats for soldiers and mercenaries of  , Ratatouille Soup is a crude dish of chunky vegetables piled in a bowl and seasoned with herbs. Originally, the recipe came from the stronghold simply called the Stronghold, to the northeast from the Jewel of the North. The keep was taken over by the famed   in the late 15  century   and was invigorated with the adventurers'  , rebuilt, and repopulated. The northern farms that supplied the keep with food are historically abundant with  ,\u00a0 ,\u00a0 , and\u00a0 , so there is no surprise that the cheapest produce feeds the army.\n Now, we all know there are several variations of the dish, each with its own unique twist. From large vegetable chunks roasted on fire and then cooked in broth to thinly sliced medallions, arranged in a bowl and cooked in tomato  , and everything in the middle. What I have prepared is a slightly less crude version of the dish one can find at a cheap inn in the north. It has a bit of presentation to appear appetizing on a plate. Still, at its core, it is the same ingredients that can be sauteed first on high heat in  , dripping until vegetables develop color and soften, or, for those of us who wish a lighter dish \u2013 vegetables will be cooked in the soup. As a side, we will top toast with the same vegetables and roast them as an open-faced  .\n Ratatouille Soup\n Makes four servings:\n Serving: \n Equipment: cast iron or broiler-safe bowls\n As a vegetable soup, the preparation for the dish is easy. We begin by preparing  : dice into even-sized cubes one and a half of each: zucchini, yellow  , eggplants, and tomatoes. Dice all the bell peppers in the same manner. Finely mince   and onion. The rest of the zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, and eggplants are to be sliced into very thin medallions, preferably with a mandoline on the thinnest setting. The medallions will be used to top each of the bowls of soup and toast at the very end.\n We will begin by adding a spoonful of vegetable oil to a soup pot and slowly cook minced onions and garlic with a dash of salt and pepper. Stir the pot occasionally as it cooks on medium-low flames. Don't be afraid of a bit of color. Once the onions are soft and slightly sweet, it should be about eight minutes. Add a cup of dry, unoaked white wine, preferably something from the   or  , as their flavor profiles fit perfectly to flavor vegetables. Continue cooking until the wine is reduced to one-fourth of its volume and the alcohol is all evaporated.\n Next, we will be adding diced vegetables and a handful of squashed tomatoes. If you are not opposed to soiling another skillet, you can pre-cook by searing diced vegetables in bacon drippings with a bit of salt and pepper. It will give the dish a more complex flavor and will make the soup's final cooking step quicker. But if you are pressed for time or catering to fey who are opposed to eating pig, simply add diced vegetables to the pot, together with seasonings,  , and herbs. Stir all the ingredients, cover, and let the soup simmer for half an hour.\n Take the cover off and taste the broth and vegetables. This is the perfect time to adjust the seasoning, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and tomato sweetness. The vegetables should still keep their shape but be soft when you bite into them. Now reserve some basil leaves for plating, and roughly rip the rest with your hands and add them to the soup. Let the soup cook for five more minutes on simmer uncovered. Meanwhile, start up the broiler and cut the bread.\n We will need to finish the soup under the broiler. Ladle the soup into cast-iron serving bowls or anything else that's broiler-safe. The soup should be thick enough to hold a layer of vegetables on top without sinking. Lightly brush bread slices with olive oil on both sides and situate them in cast-iron pans or a baking dish. They will go under the broiler with the soup. Add a spoonful of strained tomatoes to the bread and spread it over. Sprinkle it with a bit of salt and pepper. If you wish, you can add more flavor to it ahead of time by briefly cooking the strained tomatoes with basil, garlic, and a spoonful of hot red pepper paste; yes, I love using such pepper pastes! Next, start arranging thin vegetable medals on both bread slices and soup bowls. Arrange them in a circular, overlapping manner, alternating the vegetables. Sprinkle the vegetables with salt and pepper. Once the entire surface is covered, spoon strained tomatoes or flavored strained tomatoes and roughly spread them over the vegetables. Sprinkle with salt on the sauce if it's unreasoned. I like sprinkling bread crumbs over the tomato sauce to give it a bit more color and texture and adding dry gruyere cheese over the vegetables in the soup if fully optimal, but I like the fatty cheese flavor.\n Place the soup and bread under the broiler and let the vegetables on top cook. The time will be different depending on the stove, but it will take at least ten minutes. We want the vegetables on top to be soft and cooked thoroughly.\n Serve as soon as you take the soup out of the oven. Be careful, as the bowls are dangerously hot! A good wine to go with the Stronghold Ratatouille Soup is either dry, unoaked white wine or medium-bodied red wine like   from the   or   of   (Chianti, Merlot, or Pinot Noir).\n Next: a noodle dish from  ! And until then,  , friends,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, my fellow corsairs of the culinary seas! As I promised last  , today we will try our best to delve into   cuisine. Much of the elven food comes locally from whatever region they inhabit, be it the biggest   or the outskirts of  . The High Forest elves, especially those of the   people, hunt and forage for their meals but introduce some sophistication to the dishes all the same, and they are not picky at what animals they consume, as long as nothing is wasted.\n  is a pretty common dish with some variations from one community to the next, to no one's surprise. Traditional preparation called for  . The beast was gutted, deboned, and stuffed with a collection of   and  . The meat then was rolled tight, encased in  , and baked, simmering in its juices. When Surkyl was ready, the clay was cracked open, and the baked animal was portioned among the guests.\n My version has a lot of substitutes \u2013 all things you would probably easily find in your local market. We will reduce the bake size from the whole bast to some  . And stuffing will be made with leeks,  ,   (you can try   instead), brushed with sweet home-made  , and herbs. The dish will be stuffed, rolled, and baked, then sliced and plated on a bed of mash of   and  .\n Sweet mustard:\n This part is simple. Use   to grind the mustard seeds as finely as you like. I like having a bit of a crunch, so for me, it's about half-ground. Mix all ingredients together and let them soak. Give it 15-20 minutes, and then blitz the mix to smoothen it. Cover, and leave in the cold storage overnight. It is important for the mix to thicken and infuse flavors for at least 10 hours. This recipe makes more than you will need for Surkyl \u2013 we'll just use a night brush \u2013 about one and a half small kitchen spoons.\n Stuffing (2 servings):\n Slice the white part of the leeks in medallions (do not forget to wash between the layers). Toss leeks and mushrooms with about one big spoonful of neutral flavor oil and start cooking on medium-low flames. In a small bowl, combine crushed and finely minced fresh garlic,  syrup, lemon juice, and miso paste. Pour into the pan with leeks and mushrooms, stir and coat well, add water, and cook on low heat until mushrooms and leeks become soft and sweet. Adjust the amount of water if the mix gets too thick. It took me about 30 minutes on low heat.\n Surkyl (2 servings):\n Using a sharp butcher's knife, carefully slice the tenderloin lengthwise and slowly unroll it into a sheet. Place it between two sheets if you want to make less of a mess, and keep hammering it well to flatten and tenderize the meat. Remove paper sheets and sprinkle both sides with   and  .\n With a brush, spread some sweet mustard on one side of the pork sheet. Saut\u00e9 baby bok choy with salt and crushed garlic in a bit of butter until it reduces in size and wilts but doesn't loose much color. Roughly chop the leaves several times to make them bite-sized and drain all the water out by hand or on drained on some paper towels. Combine baby bok choy and mushroom-leek mix and layer them all on top of the mustard. Some optional additions include some sharp   and thinly sliced  . Now, do not be afraid of being messy; carefully but tightly roll pork while keeping the stuffing on the inside. To make sure it stays in shape, pin the roll with wooden toothpicks or tie it with butcher's twine.\n Bake uncovered in a preheated oven at 450F for 35 minutes. Make sure the internal temperature reaches 150F before serving. Optionally, you could brush the outside with melted butter, spiced with some paprika, half-way through the bake.\n While it is cooling, mix together the tuber mash - it's half and half starchy potatoes and butternut squash, boiled and mashed, combined with one large dollop of butter and 1/4 tankard of cream, seasoned with salt and white pepper.\n Carefully spice Surkyl, three slices per portion. Place a generous dollop of mash on the plate in a circular manner, top with a sliced roll, and spoon the leftover mixture of leeks and mushrooms on the side. Top with rosemary sprigs and drizzle with a bit of melted butter.\n And the dish is ready. Making Surkyl required some improvisation and replacements, but overall, I think my version was a delicious success. A good accompaniment for the dish is skillet-fried flatbreads and some fresh young white wine.\n Relatively quick recipe and surprisingly labor intensive. The next recipe I will be sharing with you is going to be a green herby stew.\n But until then,   my friends. Do not stop cooking and trying new things,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Yes, yes, I know we've traveled to the   plenty, but it is one of those regions in the   that is welcoming, has some of the simplest yet tastiest dishes, loveliest tavern maids, and the most attentive innkeepers. But the Dalelands are not just  . The   on the southwestern border of the Dalelands, leading into  , is a busy place in the summer.\n But my first visit was in the winter on the way from Cormyr to  , despite what Master Traveler   advised in his acclaimed but somewhat unreliable book on the Dalelands. In the village of  , I came across the inn marked with a pair of massive aging swords and an archway. The establishment is closed in the winter, and even after fifteen minutes of my knocking, none cared to open the door! Of course, I had to investigate. It didn't take me long to find a back door, and it was not locked as some humans were working inside. I gathered that the locked front door must've been a mistake. I strolled in, happily grinning, feeling accomplished... and also starved, to be honest. I was met with confused human faces. A woman, seemingly times taller than me, with a pretty tattoo of some feline thing on the shoulder, stepped forward to shoo me away, to my protests. But I was lucky, and a halfling matron walked out to all the kerfuffle. Apparently, the inn is being run by the loveliest hin   family. Believe it or not, they welcomed me to stay with them overnight despite the inn's seasonal closure. We've had a long evening of sharing stories of the culinary nature. The younger generation listened about the fascinating school of magic \u2013  , and recipes from faraway lands were exchanged during a taste test of a five-course meal, a bugbear's worth of smallbites, and about five dozen types of various  !\n Today's recipe was one of the two main poultry dishes, staples of the inn and cooked fresh by my hosts. It's simple:   quartered and cooked with almonds, spices, and vegetables. The bird had succulent, tender meat and a gentle almond flavor, much more subtle than one would think. The stewing mix makes a great accompaniment sauce. Let us begin!\n Chicken and brine (makes 2 generous or 4 humble servings):\n Brining your chicken is optional, but it's a good way to soften an older stewing bird. Add all ingredients together into a big pot. Crush  , slice, and crush  ; do not lose the juice; it goes into the brine, too. Bring the brine to a boil. Make sure   and   are dissolved. Turn the heat down and let it cool to room temperature. Submerge the chicken in the brine once it's cooled and leave it in cold storage overnight.\n Almond stew (makes 2 generous or 4 humble servings): \n First thing first \u2013 we need to toast the  . The easiest way is to use the preheated oven. 325F, roast for up to 10 minutes; do not crown the nuts on a baking sheet. You will see a darkened color when they are done \u2013 golden and slightly brown. Alternatively \u2013 you can toss them on a medium-hot skillet for five minutes or so, regularly tossing them around to avoid burning.\n We will need to quarter the chicken. Remove each leg first. Push the joint back until it cracks, then gently slice the skin in the front, then slice the joint. Push the leg all the way back and slice the flesh around the bone, separating the leg and a good chunk of the chicken butt. For the breast and wing - slice the breasts in the middle, carefully continue slicing along the ribs, and slice through the joint. From the back, slice around the joint. Reserve the carcass and scraps to make into delectable chicken stock later. The chicken freezes well.\n Make sure the chicken quarters are completely dry. Heat up a skillet with a spoonful of oil and sear the chicken off to give it crusty golden skin. Breasts and legs should be seared on both sides and set aside. In the same skillet, as long as there are no charred pieces, brown rolled balls of sausages and set aside.\n Clean the skillet off, melt   and the rest of the oil. Add finely cubed  , bell  , garlic, salt, and black pepper. Let them cook on medium-low flame for ten minutes, regularly stirring. Next, add diced tomatoes and tomato paste, mix well, and cook covered until tomatoes and peppers soften and release all of their liquid. This should take at most 10 minutes. Now, it is time to add  ,  , and  . Mix well. Taste.\n Split the almonds into two equal batches. Add batch number one to the stew. The second half needs to be pulverized into a smooth mash with a bit of water, chicken stock, or wine. Let them simmer together for ten more minutes on low heat to soften the nuts. Remember to stir. Add cream, stir it in, and taste for salt, pepper, and seasoning. If your stew it not thick enough \u2013 make a slurry of 2 small spoons of flour or starch with stock or water and add to the sauce. The stew will turn a gentle, lighter color. Submerge chicken and sausages in the stew, cover, and let them simmer. It will take about five to seven minutes to cook through, but you will need to flip them over halfway through. Before serving \u2013 make sure the chicken is cooked through at 165F.\n And now, it is time to serve. I went for a big girl portion \u2013 one breast and one leg per plate, but one piece would be more than enough to feed an adult. Scoop a handful of sausages onto the plate and generally pour almond stew over. Scooping it with some fresh bread would be divine. Finally, have a one-fourth of a tankard of crushed and toasted almonds, sprinkle them with a bit of salt or salted butter, add a handful of chopped fresh parsley, and top the mix over the chicken. We are ready to eat!\nAll you need for this meal now is some fresh bread or flatbread. This is one hearty dish. I recommend you save the uneaten chicken for another dish later, the one we will top with homemade dumplings.\n This is all I have to share with you this tenday. Next - we will be testing a plateful dinner of several smaller pieces. And the recipe that will follow will be all about dumplings!\n , my friends, Until we cook together again,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Well met, and welcome back to my little corner of the   \u2013  , the City of Splendors. Perhaps the most cosmopolitan place in all   and the place that I have been calling home for quite some time now. Many of my favorite dishes were discovered in the countless eateries and taprooms across the city, and this  's recipe is just that \u2013 something you can find in Waterdeep, and, frankly, I do not know where else you could. The dish is called  , and it is made with fine     exported from the   or  . I failed to discover its cultural roots, so we all can assume it was created right here. You can find this exact recipe served at the  , a busy eatery in the  , on the\u00a0 , just south of\u00a0 . The dish consists of boiled wide, flat noodles made with   dough, cooked diced and ribboned vegetables, and a healthy scoop of   cooked into a thick and sticky sauce. A generous serving of Tahllap Noodles can be accompanied by a tankard of sweet   to complement the goat's cheese flavor. But sadly, they do not customarily offer   portions to their guests; instead, they charge double for such orders. So I learned to make the noodles myself, with some supplies purchased from the good old friend of every cook \u2013  . Let's begin.\n Tahllap Noodles\nMakes two generous servings:\n Begin by preparing all the ingredients\u2014  is important. Finely chop   and one small  . Cut guanciale into cubes. Don't throw away the thick skin; it has flavor. We can toss it after the flavor is extracted. You can substitute guanciale for   salo or the more common thick-cut  . Chop off 1/3 of each of the vegetables - yellow   and  , and dice them into cubes of roughly the same size as guanciale. Thinly slice the rest of the squash and zucchini into sheets and then slice the sheets into thin strings.\n Begin by frying off diced guanciale as well as the rinds from the slice. Render fat from the cubes and cook them until the white layered fat turns translucent golden. Make sure not to overcook it; it can turn into pebbles very quickly; it should not take more than 6-7 minutes. Remove the cooked lardons and let them drain into paper towels.\n Use the same pan to fry up garlic and shallots. Unless the guanciale fat pools excessively, keep it all in the pan. Saut\u00ea the shallots in fat for several minutes so they release their flavor and aroma. Next, add diced and ribboned vegetables to the same pan along with seasonings,  , and a spring of fresh  . Saut\u00ea them all together on medium flames, regularly tossing the contents of the pan around until the vegetables soften and become golden. You know that the vegetables are done when they are soft but not mushy.\n While the vegetables are cooking, bring a pot of highly   water to a rolling boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions to al dente readiness. While the pasta is being boiled, add the goat's cheese puck to the vegetables and let it melt into the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the cream. Taste the vegetable mix and adjust the flavoring. Remember that salt will be added along with pasta water in jsut a moment.\n Transfer the cooked pasta directly to the cheese and vegetables. Immediately add a handful of baby   leaves and nuts. Stir the pan's contents and cook it for another minute or two. If you notice the sauce is too thick, add a spoonful of salty pasta water and stir.\n Now, all we need is to plate. Split the pasta and vegetables in two, wrap them around tongues, and remove them from the pan with tongues and a big spoon. Make sure the vegetable strings are intermingled with the pasta. Split the rest of the pan's contents in two, sauce, diced vegetables, and nuts, spooning it over the pasta mound on the plates. Sprinkle the plates with more nuts, fresh herbs, and some quartered cherry tomatoes.\n If you score balcony seating, serve a plate of pasta with a tankard full of mulled wine and enjoy the view of Waterdeep's  . And if you want a hin-serving, simply consider this recipe as one portion. No halfling will turn it down.\n And this is all I have for you this tenday,\n , my friends, and until next time,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, and welcome to this  's recipe. This time, I am bringing you a recipe from yet another famous adventurer. Have you heard of the  ? Of course, you have. Everyone has! Valiant adventurers and protectors of the   and the forest of  , originally known as the  .   was one of the founding members of the group and earned his spot in history books. He was known for bragging about being a great cook as long as \"you're partial to meat, tomatoes, cheese, and noodles all cooked together,\" as he used to say. Some sage was industrious enough to pen down said great recipe; the adventurer often cobbled together whilst on the road, using mostly just the things in the rucksack and things foraged from the nearby woods.\n Torm's     was just that, a collection of ingredients, cooked together and coarse thick noodles made of flour and eggs, rolled, cut, and stretched by hand. Of course, if you buy several handfuls of dried noodles at a local market \u2013 they can be used, too. This soup goes very well with a simple side sauce of grated   and hot red   paste. I am fairly sure Torm never added it to his dish, but I found that a bit of heat and zest is exactly what it needed. Let us begin!\n Dough (4 servings):\n This is the simplest type of noodle one can make. Simply pile the   in a bowl and mix it with  , make a crater in the middle, crack   in, and work the dough until it is thick and smooth. You can make it ahead of time as it keeps well in an icebox or cold storage. Quarter the dough roll and with a bit of extra flour, roll as thin as you possibly can. Then, cut lengthwise with a  , dust with flour, and gently stretch them to be even thinner. Remember, once cooked, these noodles will thicken and puff up, so there is no \"too thin\" here. Another method is rolling the dough thin, dusting it generously with flour, rolling it up, and slicing it as if you are chiffonading herbs. Set aside and let them dry.\n Soup (4 servings):\n Stock (4 servings):\n This is very much a free-form recipe. You can add more   if you like the flavor or cut the amount by half if you want it not to be overwhelming. The meat also varies;   or   are the most common, but if you want to use up your provisions, smoked and     just add to the flavor. But the soup is made with fresh stock using most scraps that will be tossed after.\n Begin by washing your  . I used leftover dark green leaves that were left after using whites in another dish. The   rinds are important, and you can double the amount I have listed to an entire pound. A good, hard, dry, aged cheese will release its flavor and fats into the soup, and then you can freely toss the rinds away. Before cooking them, scrape edible cheese into a separate bowl \u2013 thinly sliced flakes will be used to top the filled bowls. I am trying to keep the stock clear, so I am wrapping all ingredients, apart from leek and cheese, into cheesecloth:   stems, crushed  ,   scraps,  ,  , and black  . Tie the satchel tight, fill the pot with water, and combine the ingredients. Bring to a boil, then simmer for one hour. There is no need to cover; reduced stock means a stronger flavor.\n While the stock is bubbling, add a light drizzle of cooking oil to a skillet and brown the sausages; if they are already cooked, use high heat and sear them instead of cooking through. Set aside, clean the pan, add another drizzle of oil, and cook onions on medium heat. I used pearl onions for this recipe, but other types would work, too, apart from shallots and red onions. Darken the onions, regularly tossing them around the pan. We want color, but do not burn it! It is not one of the dark amber-burned onion soups! Also, prep your tomatoes \u2013 bring a pot of water to a boil, remove the stem, and score the bottoms with a cross\u2014place tomatoes in boiling water for a minute. Remove, peel the skin, and quarter. Scoop the seeds from all the quarters with your fingers or a spoon. What now is left is tomato flesh. Roughly chop them and set aside.\n After the stock was simmering for an hour, strain or fish the contents out and discard. Taste. Add salt and white pepper to taste. Now add cooked onions, tomatoes, and sausages and simmer for about twenty minutes. Taste once again and adjust the seasoning.\n Lastly, add the noodles. Thin noodles will cook in three minutes, but thicker cuts will remain chewy unless cooked for five to six minutes.\n Scoop the soup into serving bowls while it is still piping hot. Top it with flakes of prepared cheese and freshly sliced  . As a side, I made a simple sauce of equal parts grated   and spicy red pepper paste. Sprinkle with salt, add half a tiny spoon of lemon juice, and top with finely chopped parsley.\n The soup itself will be clear and reddish in color. It is chunky and tasty. A spoonful of the sauce makes the heat refreshing, and I can't recommend it more as a summer dish cooked on the trade route's side with a band of comrades and traveling companions. A generous tankard of   is almost mandatory.\n And here we are-Torm's noodle soup, as recorded for posterity and, evidently, cooked for   during their travels together.\n Next-pastries from  ! Please return to witness my eternal struggles in baking!\n , friends,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n This tenday's recipe is part two of   dumplings. There, we talked about how   is not a common filling for dumplings but something brought over from inland. Different variants can be seen across  , including Tethyr. We are returning to the coastal city of   once again. The inn called the   includes the daily offering of stew made with leftovers and scraps of vegetables and meats served in other dishes. Dumplings are available as an optional fix-in for jsut a couple of coppers extra. I always advertise cooking responsibly, and any savvy tavernkeep knows that one has to count every  . Just like the stew, dumplings differed depending on what was available, from diced leftover   to lamb, vegetables, or just buttered dough. My recipe uses leftover fowl from the   chicken recipe to flavor the stew of overripe  ,  ,  , and   scraps. Once the stew is ready, dumplings and arranged on top and covered to be cooked by the liquids and the steam. To finish the platings, we will top the dumplings with a bit of cheese and blast it under a salamander, either creature, if one is around, or the cooking device. This step-by-step recipe ensures that even the most inexperienced cooks can master the skill of making a delicious Tethyrian Yardarm stew.\n Dough (makes 14 dumplings):\n Filling (makes 14 dumplings):\n We began by making dumplings last tenday. See   dumplings to refresh your memory. But we will be brief. These dumplings call for a simple dough made with   and boiling water with just a pinch of  . Work the dough until it is smooth, wrap tightly and let it rest and chill while you make the filling.\n The filling will be a mixture of ground fatty lamb meat, finely shredded  , minced  , salt,  , and   seed. To shape the dumplings \u2013 break the dough into 14 equally-sized pieces and roll them into flat circles about the size of your palm. Scoop a small spoonful of filling into the center, then pull the sides up, crimping them and making a twist. These dumplings can be frozen to be used later or cooked in broth, steamed, or fried in butter and oil. This dish, however, will have them cooked in the stew.\n Stew (makes 4 servings):\n Garnish: curly parsley, aged cheddar (optional)\n Set the dumplings aside and begin preparing the stew. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a drizzle of oil inside a pot and cook finely diced onions on medium-low flame together with a leaf of bay. I had a few other kitchen pieces to use up so I chopped a   and sweated it together with onions. Once onions are translucent and soft, add a bit of cooking   and simmer until it is all reduced. Now, it's time to add the thickener. Sprinkle a spoonful of flour into the vegetables and evenly coat the vegetables in it, allowing the butter to absorb it all, forming a roux. Add a spoonful of tomato paste if you feel your tomatoes don't taste tomato-y enough. Cook for 3 minutes more to get rid of raw flour taste.\n Add chicken stock and tomato mash in. Season the stew with   powder, garlic, white pepper, salt, fresh  , and a pinch of  . Optional addition \u2013 a handful of dried shiitake  , crush or grind a few to turn them into seasoning and mix into the pot.\n Lastly, we are using leftover chicken cooked with almonds. Use all the meat you have available: white meat, dark meat, and, if the skin is well crispiness, use it as well. This stew is a great way of using last night's roasted fowl or any pieces of meat still on the bird after it was butchered. Cover and let the stew simmer for at least 20 minutes. However, like all stews, it tastes better with a longer simmer and after being stored overnight and reheated.\n And to finish the stew, place the number of land dumplings on the stew's surface. It should be thick enough to keep them afloat. Cover tightly and let them cook. Cook for 20 minutes if the dumplings are fresh. It is fine to submerge them in the stew if you want to speed the cooking up. If you are using frozen dumplings, cover and cook for 35-40 minutes.\n To serve, ladle the stew in cast iron serving bowls (or anything else oven-safe). Fish the cooked dumplings out and arrange them on top. Optional garnish \u2013 sprinkle the dumplings with shredded sharp cheese and blast the entire serving bowl in the broiler for a mere minute, or let the cheese burn under a salamander. Top with curly leaf parsley and serve with a generous spice of fluffy milk bread.\n Enjoy an eveningfeast of the Yardarm dumpling stew, and remember, this recipe is a mere guide to the tavern's perpetual stew. Unlike other dishes, this stew prefers the use of canned and preserved tomatoes, making it a popular meal in the colder months.\n And that is all I have to share this tenday, my friends. For the next several tendays we will focus on more sweet side of cooking and even if we fail together, it will be an excellent experience from which we can learn and improve!\n Until next time,  !\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n As I promised you last  , friends, today we are going to talk a bit more about Aurora and some of the goods we love to procure from her lovely warehouses and shops across  . We have used Aurora's   in several dishes in the past: we made a northern stew, we added it into a drink, and, the last tenday, we crushed some of the chestnuts in spiced syrup. Let us talk about this simple treat. Aurora deals in chestnuts from  , the  , and  - the very differently flavored types of tree nut. Kara-Turan nuts from the island nation of   are labeled as \"kuri\" if you even need to purchase some. They tend to be dried; fresh nuts come from the north, but they are smaller in size and have a more savory taste, and Tethyrean nuts are big, plump, and sweet, preferably what we would want to use for this. Aurora's nuts are shelled and boiled in sugar and spices and immediately jarred for sale. The nuts tend to spoil quickly without magical intervention, but the syrup acts as a preservative. But I can help you save quite a few   in making your own, and they will last for many months in your storage, and the syrup that will be left behind can be used for a myriad of confectionary or mixological uses. Some species of chestnut are also more precious than others; for example, chestnut trees from   were ravaged during the Spellplague. One of many calamities it brought to   included   's eruption that unleashed   and elemental voles into the region. Voles showed particular love for the Neverwintran chestnuts, and they managed to almost completely exterminate the entire population of the tree before Mount Hotenow was quelled and the   banished. As of  , Neverwintran chestnut trees survived near the village of   and within the small arbor, a public park at the center of the  . According to one of the more or less recent editions of \" \", a small conclave of druids from the   enlisted help from the   of   to return the chestnut tree population to its 14  century numbers. But anyway, let us talk about the sweet treat.\n Chestnuts in spiced syrup\n Makes one quart:\n This recipe calls for fresh chestnuts if they are available, but they can be substituted for toasted or boiled and roasted shelled nuts. There is one thing you need to consider, though, before picking chestnuts for this recipe. Fresh chestnuts have a rich and nutty flavor, and when you cook them in syrup, they take on the sweet taste as well as absorb the syrup and spicy flavors. When using pre-cooked nuts, you will have denser nuts with a gentle, sweet flavor of  . But they will absorb the spice flavor significantly less in this case, and they will become denser and more crumbly after being cooked in syrup. But apart from this difference, the recipe remains unchanged. However, fresh nuts require two additional steps: pre-cooking and boiling in water first.\n This part applies to fresh or freshly vacuum-packed chestnuts. Using a pairing knife, cut around the shell, half crosswise, but do not cut into the nut. Do so for each nut. Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and blanch the scored nuts in boiling water for 8 minutes. Turn the heat off and leave the nuts in hot water while you peel them one at a time. Hold a nut in a kitchen towel and gently squeeze the nut out of the shell. Cover them and let them cool while you work on the syrup.\n In a deep saucepan, mix white   and water and turn up the heat as you stir to dissolve the crystals. No need to keep it on a rolling boil, so once the syrup begins to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer.\n Using a pairing knife, slice a   bean in half lengthwise, but do not cut all the way through. Flip the pairing knife over and press the dull side into the bean and scrape away from the bean's stem, pushing out the seeds. Transfer the seeds and the bean itself into the syrup, and add  ,  , and  . Stir and let simmer for five minutes or so.\n Add in chestnuts, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for 30 minutes if you are using fresh nuts, or 20 if they come cooked, peeled, and jarred.\n Turn the heat off, cover, and let them cool to room temperature. Once cool, you can transfer them to another container, or, if you are confident in your sterilizing and jarring skills, preserve them for the future.\n They can stay good for a very long time as long as the nuts are submerged in syrup. Mine kept for several months and I consumed them all up long before they spoiled. The syrup itself can be used to mix a drink or add to pastries.\n I am using a simple way of topping   from   in   with both the nuts and the syrup. You will need two scoops of vanilla ice cream; top it with spiced chestnuts, crushed walnuts, chopped  , and drizzle with spiced syrup. For   ice cream, I used mint, walnuts, and chestnuts and topped it with spiced orange syrup.\n And here is all you need to know to make Aurora's Chestnuts in Spiced Syrup, you would need to make Aurora's  .\n This recipe was supposed to be released months ago, but, scatterbrain that I am, I misplaced my notes, and they ended up in the \"published\" stack somehow. But it's better later than never! Enjoy!\n Next time, pies and rolls! But not before a tiny break.\n Until then, friends,  \n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Even a casual shopper leafing through   or visiting one of her shops notices the abundant selection of fruits, vegetables, nuts, preserves, seasonings, and   of all flavors and colors, layered in a pleasant rainbow. But even the busiest fruit monger has unsold leftovers. And Aurora's enterprise decided to use them up to make in-house confections, such as   in spiced syrup, something that we will be using in this recipe and the next  , I'll share with you how to make some on your own. Leftover fruit - it gets sugared, nuts? Soaked in liqueurs or spirits. Leftover apples? Mash and stew them.    ? Toss it with all other sweet spices, mix all of them, and bake. That is basically what   is. Aurora's fruitcakes are typically baked in loaf pans \u2013 the cheaper variant available, regularly sold as a tavern smallbite to nibble on or add to an  's rations sack. Some   like to carry an old loaf with them to soak in wine or rum and eat slice by slice and, as long as it's well-dried out, use them to clobber a stray goblin or two. Some traveling mages are known for placing enchantments on such improvised flails: an old fruitcake in a sack, used as a mel\u00ea weapon. Very inventive!\n A more expensive type of Aurora's fruitcake is not baked to last; instead, its fruits and nuts are soaked in some strong woody, smoky, ot sweet alcohol, and its dough is made with cocoa,  , and applesauce for color and moistness. The cakes are baked, allowed to dry, packed in fanciful pressed tins decorated with Aurora's face and logo, and soaked in more alcohol. My great aunt, who lives in the Docks of  , is especially fond of boozy cakes; they make her \"jolly.\" Be prepared to put a bit of time and effort into the cake, and ignore fruitcake haters. Let us begin.\n Spiced Fruitcake\n Makes 14 servings:\n Marinade:\n Cake Batter:\n The recipe needs to be prepped ahead: We will need to make a boozy marinade to soak the fruit and nuts in. If you are using syrup   from another recipe on here, they shall not be marinated. Mix together   juice and  ., or any other smoky flavored strong spirits. Combine candied fruit and peel mix, diced candied   peel, diced candied  , red   soaked in syrup, diced and pitted  , whole  ,   and/or sultans, sliced  , and dried sweet   in a deep bowl and pour over them the mix of bourbon and juice. Cover and set aside for a full day.\n The next day, strain the soaked fruit and nuts and set them aside. Dice or break apart candied chestnuts and add to the nut and fruit mix. You can reserve bourbon and orange juice and use it for something else, or even reduce the liquid and cook it with fruit to make a flavorful jam.\n Coat two 7x2-inch deep cake pans with   or shortening and place a ring of parchment paper on the bottom of both to help you extract the cake when it's cooked. In a large mixing bowl, combine ground spices:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Maztican cocoa, baking powder, and fine salt. Sift the flour into the bowl and stir the ingredients to spread all of them equally.\n Place butter in another bowl and let it come to room temperature. Once soft, add brown and white sugar and cream them together until smooth and light, using a rubber spatula. Switch utensils and, using a wide whisk, start beating the mixture to work as much air into it as you can.\n Crack your eggs and separate the whites and yolks. Add the yolks to the sugar mix and the whites to a very clean metal bowl; we will be back to it shortly. Work the yolks into the mix using a spatula. Once incorporated, add   or apple butter, bourbon or rum (whichever you prefer), and vanilla extract. Mix it all with a whisk, slowly trickling in treacle as you work the ingredients together. Add fruit and nuts into the cake batter and fold them into it with a spatula to spread evenly. If the bowl where you set the fruit aside has some leaked marinade, dump it into the mixture too!\n Now \u2013 the worst part of the recipe. Add a pinch of cream of tartar to the whites and whip them with a large whisk until they reach the soft peak stage. Do not hesitate now! Add the whipped whites into the batter and fold them in with the spatula in circular motions around the sides several times until the batter takes all of it in. It will become lighter in color.\n For the fluffiest dough, you need to let the batter rest for several hours in a cool place, but not in the cold storage or the icebox. Do not forget to cover it tightly. Ideally, you would need four hours or so. But if you are in a hurry, give it two hours of resting time. Then, start prepping the oven and making supplies.\n Put a sheet pan on the very bottom rack of the oven and fill it with boiling hot water. Preheat the oven to 250\u00b0F for 30 minutes. Scoop rested fruit cake batter into the greased and lined pans. Do not fill to the brim; the cake will puff up during baking. Slowly bake them for two and a half hours and refill the boiling water if needed. They are ready once the cake tester comes out clean and the top looks dry. The hot water in the tray will keep the cake more moist on the inside. You might need to bake a bit longer.\n Once done, let the cakes cool in pans until you can handle them without a healer's aid. Gently flip the pans and take the cakes out. Rest them on a wire rack to cool all the way. Keep the paper on the bottom; it will stop the cakes from sticking to the rack.\n Once fully cool, you can serve or put in tins, drizzle with sweet or bitter liquors, and cover to serve the next day. When I serve it, I like topping it with some candied fruit and a gravy boat filled with sweet liquor to drizzle over even more! Who would say no to more jolly-juice?\n I tested this recipe back in the holiday season last year and only now got an opportunity to share Aurora's secrets with you, and this write-up ended up being longer than I thought it would be. So much so that I decided to split Aurira's Chestnuts in Syrup into its own entry for the next   so that we could not run this chapter in the compendium for another 800 words...\n Well, here we are; I hope you enjoyed this tenday's recipe. And I can not wait to share more of them with you.\n ,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Something different here for this  's recipe. This last kiss, known as  , is a sweetmeat from the city of   and is several generations old at the very least. The version I have here comes from the  's archives. A collection of makeshift books that once belonged to an     guide named   can be found in the section dedicated to  , the famed explorer and the namesake of the city itself. Dradeel was the sole survivor of Balduran's fateful voyage on the   from   back to Baldur's Gate. The ship never reached its destination, and Dradeel was left fending for his life amidst   on the  . When he was found and rescued, his mental state had greatly deteriorated, and his notes and writings were collected and donated to the High House of Wonders, alongside several   of Balduran himself. Some today claim that Balduran was the second survivor of the shipwreck and ended up being transformed into a  , but that seems to be a strange and fantastical tale to me. But I digress. One of Dradeel's books was a cookbook that collected recipes from his youth. Baldur's Delight was said to be named after Balduran, or \"Mother Baldur,\" according to the book. However, that is nonsense, as every Baldurian knows the city hero's name, and the elvish lifespan is grand. The candy recipe dates back to Dradeel's mother's mother's father, which would make it older than Balduran, a mere  . The treat, however, is sweet and delicate, and I will list both the original recipe, as it appears in the manuscript, and my notes and adjustments to make it foolproof. I've prepared several versions and fed my neighbors well, making some of them demand more as the treats are truly addictive. Dradeel's ancestor was indeed a \"real whiz around pots and pans.\"\n Baldur's Delight\n Makes twenty sweetmeats:\n Original recipe:\n My adjusted recipe:\n First, we need to prepare mise en place: add a big spoonful of rose petals to a cup of water in a pot. Bring them to a boil, then remove the pot from the heat and let them steep for ten minutes. Next, strain the liquid and discard the rose petals. Using a juicer, squeeze the juice out of two whole oranges or more to get a cup full of fresh juice. Optionally, use a microplate and zest one full orange to add to the sweetmeats later.\n Firstly, mix half a cup of cold water with cornstarch until incorporated and set aside. Do the same with hot water and gelatin. Once the gelatin is fully dissolved, transfer the hot gelatin water to a sauce pot big enough to contain all the ingredients after they thicken. Turn the heat up and whisk orange juice and all of the sugar in. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, start pouring in cold water with cornstarch vigorously, whisking the liquids to incorporate. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer everything for fifteen minutes. You might need to turn the flames down if the bubbling is dangerously close to boiling over. The starch by now would've expanded, making the pot filled with thick ooze-like translucid caramel-colored goo.\n Next, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the nuts, grated zest, part of the coconut flakes, and a spoonful of rosewater.\n While the mix is still hot, quickly grizzle a bit of oil into a square 8-inch by 8-inch casserole dish. Place a sheet of waxed paper over it, lining the bottom, leaving some extra flopping on both sides to pull the candy out of the mold later. Spread the hot candy mixtures over it flat. Sprinkle the rest of the coconut flakes over it and very gently press them into the candy just a little bit. Loosely cover the candies with another sheet of paper and put them into a cold box to let them set.\n Once they are all set, pull the sweetmeat sheet out and cut it with a sharp knife into bite-sized pieces. Now, all you need to do is sprinkle them with a bit of cinnamon, allspice, or just eat them. \n These treats are surely originating from Tethyr and possibly even further south, knowing what ingredients are traditionally added to the sweetmeat and the fact that a very similar treat is found in   as well as in some markets of  . One also wonders if a sweet and spicy version can be done and enjoyed. But that is a task for another tenday.\n Enjoy the candy and share it as a sign of friendship or affection with loved ones. And keep an eye out for an announcement about a collection of recipes coming to a   stall near you!\n Until the next tenday,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n You've asked for it, and I delivered. A sweet snack from the famous city of  . Today I'll tell you about the most common   recipe of just a few common ingredients. I was told that this recipe dates all the way back to when the Gate was called   and was nothing but a simple village. If you see a child on the streets of Baldur's Gate, she would likely have a pocketful of these   and   cookies.\n Let us not waste any more time and begin.\n Cookies:\n For this recipe, we will need three-fourths of a tankard of unsalted  , three-fourths of a tankard of sifted confectioner's sugar, a single  's  , half a small spoon of   puree or extract, half a small spoon of   extract, two generous spoonfuls of cinnamon, a small spoon of pulverized   seeds (tahini), a pinch of  , and two and a half tankards of  .\n Start by warming up your butter and creaming it together with powdered sugar until smooth. Next, add almond, vanilla, egg, salt, and tahini. Mix well until fully incorporated, then add cinnamon, turning the mixture brown. Mix it well, and do not be stingy with cinnamon.\n Now start gradually adding the flour in, mixing it in thoroughly until the entire mix becomes an oily, soft, and malleable dough. We want to feel like sticky wet sand or working clay. Set it aside in a cool place for about an hour to make it easier to work with.\n Preheat your oven to 375F. While it is warming up, roll the dough until it's one inch thick. However, being precise here is not as important. Use a cookie cutter to shape the dough into crescents. If you do not have a cutter on hand, take a tallglass and use its rim as a cutter. Round cookies are right with me, and street urchins won't complain.\n Place the cookies on a sheet pan and bake for seven to ten minutes until they have no bounce and are hard and crumbly. Let them cook before giving them out to kids. Dust them with powdered sugar, and that is it. Baldurian cookies are ready.\n These cookies are fatty and dry, so as long as you keep them in a dry, airtight container, they will last you for over a week.\nA simple recipe for simple folk. Next time, we are going back to baking and will work on bread!   would be jealous!\nI know, this   we had a short recipe, but more is coming, that I can promise you, my friends.\n , until the next time.\n Yours as always,\n Juniper Churlgo. \n \n \n Well met, my friends, and happy  ! However, this  's recipe has nothing to do with this winter festival. As you can recall, we baked a huge loaf of   a tenday ago, flavored with   and brown  . Well, as promised, today we will use up a bunch of sugarbread leftovers now that we have given it time to dry up and become stale. I prepared sweet and savory variants of the simplest of all dishes\u2014 . The sweet variant comes to us from the freezing   in the   of  .\n The Bloodstone Lands are cold, remote, and have long winters, so their customary dishes are simple and hardy, made with a lot of leftovers, stale and preserved products, dried seasoning from far away, and whatever was safely stored in ice boxes. As such, Bloodstonian bread pudding is a sweet treat, a simple custard-like dessert fit for the Baron's table. This will be a quick recipe, so let us not waste more time and begin!\n Bread pudding (3 servings):\n Beat together  , sugar, and   until the mix is smooth. Slowly add warm   in, beating the mix with a whisk until fully incorporated. Cube the stale bread; we need it to be dry so it will absorb the liquid better. If you are using fresh bread, cube it and pop it into an oven at a low temperature to dry it out.\n Use butter to grease ramekins generously. In a separate bowl, mix together bread and dried fruit. I recommend you chop the fruit up first. Spoon the bread and fruit into the ramekins and press them tightly in. Add the spices to the egg mix and whisk it again until frothy. Carefully spoon the mixture over the bread, filling the ramekins fully. If you don't like dry bread on top, soak the cubes in the mix beforehand and then spoon them into buttered ramekins. Try to ensure the fruit's even distribution.\n Bake them in a preheated oven at 375\u00b0 F for about 25 minutes. The pudding is ready when it's puffed up in the oven, and the egg mix is jiggly but does not look wet. To serve, I made a thick peach syrup by using jarred  . Reserve the peach liquid, and add a dash of   and 1/3  a tankard of white sugar. I cooked it until it thickened and reduced, served it on the side for dipping, and drizzled some on top with toasted   seeds. Another traditional serving is dusted with powdered sugar or drizzled with caramel.\n And this is all I have for you this tenday. We used up leftover sugarbread and made a northern treat worthy of a pauper and a baron.\n The next tenday, we will use the last of the sugarbread for savory bread pudding with just a hint of sweetness, as customary in  .\n I hope you celebrate the winter festivals with your family and friends.  ,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n As the festivities are winding down and the new year is beginning, let us try something special. I fully admit I am not a baker, and I am not very good at pastry \u2013 I never had patience. If we travel back to the vast   to visit   again, you are sure to be recommended to visit the famed   \u2013 a fabulous bakery run by the   family in the  . Their menus are always filled with sweets that will make your hairy toes curl, and the aroma of baking bread and confections could be smelled from blocks away. The Downunda   is one of my favorites. There is not one fruit tastier than   for us,  .\n I tried several times to find out the exact recipe and even once tried to get the baker drunk and reveal all the secrets. But, in the end, there were so many holes in my intel that I had to fill all the gaps and do some improvisation. So here we go\u2014a long recipe for the new year celebration. This recipe is for a small cake of 4 servings. Like with other pastries, cake recipes are hard to scale up or down, so be warned.\n Cake batter:\n For the recipe, you will need butter to be warm and softened and bananas to be overripe, fragrant, and mushy. That can be achieved by freezing the   with a   or placing them in an ice box until they turn completely brown. This is done to bring the banana taste out. Prepare the cake tins \u2013 grease them generously with   or  , cut out a circle of   paper, and place it on the bottom of the greased tins. And finally, preheat the oven to 325F. \n Sift the flour into a bowl, add   and mix. In a separate bowl, cream together soft, warm butter with   and   until the mix is light and creamy. Use a whisk and add eggs one at a time as you incorporate them. Next, do the same with banana mash, nuts, and vanilla extract. Once smooth, add baking soda and a spoonful of   juice. Whisk and start adding buttermilk and flour a bit at a time, alternating the two. Whisk and incorporate vigorously to make the resulting batter fluffy.\n Pour the batter into greased cake tins, but do not fill them; remember, the mix will rise a bit. Bake for 50 minutes and take out to cool completely once the cake-tester some out clean. While the cake cools, we will make the sauce and frosting.\n Caramel drizzle:\n To make the sauce, begin by melting sugar and salt in water in a saucepan, then bring it to a boil as you whisk the mix constantly. Continue boiling and sugar, gently agitating it, until it turns to gold and then amber. Be warned: caramelized sugar will turn rancid quickly if you don't pay attention to the heat. Have a small bowl of water and a brush ready, regularly brushing the sides of the saucepan with water to avoid crystalizing the sugar.\n Immediately once the color is amber, start adding butter, cubed in smaller bits ahead of time. Once the butter is melted and you whisk it in., remove from the heat and slowly whisk room-temperature cream in. The resulting mix should be thick and satiny caramel sauce. Set aside to cool to room temperature, covered.\n Frosting: \n Decoration:\n Use a metal whisk to whip warm, soft butter together with confectioner's sugar until creamy. Combine with  , salt, and caramel. Whisk until the frosting is smooth and thick enough to hold the shape. Make sure the frosting is cooled as well as the cake before assembly.\n Take the cake out of the tin. If the cake's top is uneven and rises above the tin, use a long knife to even the top. Slice both cakes along the center. Spread a layer of frosting and top it with a layer of slices of bananas between the layers. Pipe the frosting on top and decorate with walnuts and slices of banana. Drizzle the caramel along the sides and on top, and add a sprinkle of gold-colored sugar.\n And it is easy to slice and serve. The cake itself is a bit tougher than other types of cake as it is close to being banana bread, but caramel and fresh bananas make it work well. If you like it a bit moister, I recommend you brush each layer with some sweet spiced rum.\n It's a nice recipe to start the year with, but the Downunda Patisserie has so many other treats we can try and make ourselves in the next  ; I can't wait to visit again! But next time \u2013 we are making   food from one of the largest forests in  !\n Until the next time we cook,  , friends,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n We are returning to   in   once again. The famous and locally acclaimed   brings this meal end's last kiss. The city itself is multi-racial and multi-cultural, and, to no surprise, Downunda caters to the   and   pallet. These tiny   are sold as a handfood for the road and can be seen layered with   and topped for the best eatery presentation. There is one major secret ingredient that oh so appeals to the   of the Vast: these sponges are scented with   essence. A minor secret ingredient is a jam made with young pinecones. But cream itself is uninspiredly uninteresting. I remember a story about how this recipe came to be. It was once drunkenly shared with me by the man called  . Yes, a   and an adventurer.\n According to him, the recipe was birthed by a simple miscommunication when an   dignitary, accompanied by her   consort, many decades ago, requested a very specific thing to cap off a feast with. Still, the cooks, who knew nothing of the language, assumed she was asking for a dish made out of pine needles. Confused and fearing causing an international incident, the chef sent a kitchen boy with a panicked and rushed message to his friend of a   persuasion \u2013 a skilled  . The boy returned with a bottle of alcohol, thickly flavored with pine needles, and several jars of young pinecones soaked in molasses and sugar, aged with a selection of  , and a fresh pine wreath. What the chef ended up making was a two-tiered cake, over-flavored with pine extract and whipped cream \u2013 also pine-flavored, and decorated with chewy preserved pine cones and sugared pine needles. The dignitaries tried the cake and politely refused seconds, thinking that dish was a strange local custom. Needless to say, the cake was not what they expected to see: all the couple wanted was a simple quaff of sparkling pine-fermented  . Thinking the feast was a smashing success, the chef made a lighter version of the pine cake and with time, it did find popularity among the Fair Folk of Ravens Bluff.\n This tenday's recipe will help you make the sponge and frosting. But also will teach you to make your own pine extract or, a good substitution for the flavor,   extract. And lastly, if you have time and pinecones \u2013 we can name some of that exotic jam.\n Mini sponge (makes ten single layers or five stacked):\n Begin by creaming warmed butter in a bowl with confectioner's sugar. Using a soft spatula, mix the butter and sugar into a light and smooth paste. Separate eggwhites from eggyolks. Add yolks, flavor extract, and salt. Mix until incorporated. In a second bowl, sift the flour and mix it with baking powder. Start mixing the butter with the sifted flour, gradually incorporating the entire amount. The batter is done when no flour clumps remain.\n Meanwhile, using a large whisk, floppy the egg whites until they reach the soft-peak stage \u2013 the whites are fluffy and thick enough to stay in the bowl even if it is turned upside down. The next part is probably the most difficult. Using a soft spatula, start folding the eggwhites into the batter.\n While the oven is preheating to 350F, grease your miniature cake molds with a bit of soft butter. Sprinkle the buttered molds with flour and swirl it around to cover all sides evenly. Note that the cake will rise during baking. It should take about 15 minutes. Let the cakes cool before removing them from the molds and especially before you apply any frosting.\n Depending on what molds you use, you might want to stack the sponge cake, cut it in half to make a layer of frosting, or even add a frosting blob on top. However, this is fully optional.\n Brown sugar frosting (makes ten servings):\n Whip all the ingredients together until the sugar and butter form a thick frosting that keeps its shape. If you feel the mixture is too lumpy and dry, ass up to two spoonfuls of milk as you whip.\n Another thing we would need to decorate is melted brown sugar, and rosemary leaves, or sprigs coated in it and hardened. If you wish, you can use the brown sugar syrup to turn it into caramel to top the sponge with. To make brown sugar syrup, heat brown sugar up with the same amount of water added in a saucepan until the sugar melts. Brush the pan's sides with a wet brush to avoid crystallization. Once the sugar is thick and liquid, drop pieces of rosemary in the syrup, toss it around, pick it up, and leave it to try on a wire rack or a silicone mat to avoid sticking. \n Now, let's have a brief talk about how to make your own pine or rosemary essence if you don't have a potionmaker or an alchemist nearby. All you need is clear, high-proof alcohol, like vodka, the plants, and time. Place about half a tankard of pine needles or rosemary leaves and stems into a bottle and pour eight ounces of vodka. Shake a bit to bruise the leaves, and let be. The extract will be ready in about three days.\n Pinecone jam (makes one quart):\n This is simple but very time-consuming. Wash the pinecones in cold water and place them in a big boiling pot with all of the ingredients. Bring to a boil and continue boiling on a medium-high flame for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off and let the pot cool completely. The pinecones will turn brown, and the sugar liquid will take on the same dark color. Place the jam back on the medium-high flame and bring to a boil once more. Boil for half an hour, then remove from the flame and let cool. Repeat the process at least one more time. From now on, each time you repeat the cycle, the sugar water will be reduced and get thicker and thicker. Check for the desired viscosity. Now, all you need is to jar the jam. Do not forget to sterilize jars and tops in hot steam or boiling water beforehand.\n Now that everything is cool, we can assemble. The simplest presentation is a single cake disk drizzled with caramel and topped with brown sugar from the jam, a couple of pine cones, and sugared rosemary. And yes, the pine cones are soft, sweet, edible, and quite floral. For a more fancy presentation \u2013 stack two disks after flattening the bottoms with a knife. Smear frosting between the two layers and from the top, imitating a snow-covered land. Decorate with pinecones and rosemary, and can even dust them with confectioner's sugar to make them look snowy.\n And this is all I have for you this tenday. Next, we will try to make a halfling type of bread, and the next recipe will be a jellyfied dessert from the  !\n Until the next time,  .\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Endevver Buns, sometimes called   rolls, or more colorfully \u2013 Endevver's Reveltongue. Despite these sweet buns being invented in  , I am bringing you a recipe I encountered in   of the   of all places. A young girl recommended this little bakery in the cold frontier town. Its name is alluding me, but the young lady was named  , and she proudly claimed that the Endevver Buns were the best long the  . I doubt Kira's advertisement was true to life, but these cinnamon rolls were indeed sweet and fluffy. Unlike rolls from  , both cinnamon and sugar are more expensive that far up north. So instead of sugar, they use preserves.\n Buns: \n To make the dough, you will need 1/4 ounce of dry  , a single tankard of  , half-a-tankard of  , one-third of a tankards of  , two large  , a generous pinch of salt and between four and four and a half tankards of    . For the stuffing, you will need a generous amount of cinnamon, one-fourth of a tankard of melted butter, and one 14 or 15-ounce jar of sweet   preserves. For the glaze \u2013 one container of condensed milk (ask your local wizard to help you with that), a   bean, a drizzle of   extract, and a small spoonful of arrowroot starch or confectioner's sugar.\n As per tradition, make the dough the night before and cool it, or one hour before you are ready to roll it but left in a warm place to let the yeast do its magic. Sift flour and add salt; mix well. Stir together warm milk, sugar, and yeast and let it come alive. Once your liquid has a thick cover of yeast foam, beat eggs into the liquid along with softened butter until evenly incorporated, then start adding flour gradually, in small batches incorporating well. As you notice your dough is coming together, continue kneading for not more than eight minutes. Your dough will become smooth. Brush it with a bit of oil or melted butter, cover it, and let it rise for one hour in a warm place.\n Frosting:\n \nWhile the dough is rising, warm your sweetened condensed milk in a saucepan, add the rest of the ingredients, bring the temperature up, and mix well to avoid lumps. Remember to cut open and scrape out seeds from the vanilla pod and add the husk and the scooped flesh in. Taste and make sure you like the flavor. Transfer to a squeeze bottle or a sauce boat and let it cool. The cooler the glaze is the thicker and silkier it be. It will be runny if you try pouring it over hot buns or if the sauce is still hot.\n When the dough noticeably rises, separate it in two and roll both of them out into flat sheets. Warning: this dough will puff up dramatically, worthy of the   stage. So roll the dough quickly and thinly. Before you start applying jam, generously grease your baking container. Now comes the hard part. You can either apply your stuffings to the half of the sheet then fold over the other side, incasing jam. Then cut the folded sheets into long strips and roll them. Another option is to cut your sheets into strips as wide as your finger is long, smearing jam on its half, then fold and roll. But I'm getting ahead of myself. First thing first, brush the entire sheet with melted butter. Here, if you want to add extra sugar - you sprinkle it all over the sheet. Now empty half of the cloudberry jam jar on the dough and smear it around, so half of the dough is covered. Dust the jam with a generous amount of cinnamon. Carefully fold the second half of the sheet over and straighten. Take a very sharp knife and slice the folded dough into long ribbons. We will roll out buns, so they vaguely resemble a  , because Kira's dad was supposed to be a  . Each ribbon is to be rolled from both sides inward so it forms something resembling a \"B.\" Now place a small ring mold, or a candied cherry in my case, on the opposite side of the rolled dough and pull the sides around the mold or cherry, forming a harp's bend. Carefully transfer all your buns to the baking dish. Hint: after you fold your dough in two, chill it to solidify the jam and the dough to make rolling easier and less messy.\n Bake your Endevver Bun for twenty minutes in a preheated oven at 350F. When they are browned, let them cool before glazing. They are served with fresh   drizzled with the same glaze for sweetness and served with warm blueberry  , steeped with milk,  , vanilla, and spices.\n The result will please you, I am sure. These fluffy rolls are called Endevver's Reveltongue for a reason \u2013 they taste like a revel in your mouth. Have I had them for the eveningfeast and the second eveningfeast and the pre-slumber snack? Yes. Is Targos worth a visit just for the buns? Yes, but you should stop by the   for its lovely drinks and roasts. Maybe we will talk about them at some point later.\n Well, it was a lovely dish ti share with you, my friends.   and until the next  .\n Yours as always,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Have you heard of the land of mages in the south called  ? A lovely place if you're a   and if you're worshiping   of the Mother of all Magic,  . If you ever have an opportunity to walk the massive open-air plazas of  , take it. These intricately decorated spaces are often used for festivals, celebrations, and fairs. And throughout the year, they are filled with street vendors peddling local comfort foods and more exotic consumables. One such treat is what everyone knows as Hangman's Noose \u2013 a frybread dusted in spices and sugar.\n These pastries were made of braided dough, looped at the bottom. They were fried in massive cauldrons of magically-heated oil, then hung to dry, and tossed in sugar and spice to order.\n Dough:\n Dusting:\n We will try and replicate this street delight today. We will need  ,  , a single large  ,  ,    , and just a dash of salt. It is a simple type of dough that is mixed together, magically proofed, and shaped to be fried immediately. This bread is reminiscent of yeasty doughnuts, so it will be fluffy.\n Mix a bit of warm milk and yeast with a teaspoon of sugar and let it bloom. Beat the egg and add it to the yeast, then add sifted flour and sugar, the rest of the milk, and a pinch of salt. Mix well until the dough is smooth. Continue kneading the dough until it's elastic and stretchy. It should take about 5 minutes. Set aside and let the gluten rest for at least 30 minutes.\n While the dough is relaxing, mix together spices and confectioner's sugar:  ,  ,  , powdered  , and  .\n When the dough is rested, you can easily stretch it without the pieces shrinking. Each Hangman's Noose will need three pieces f dough (or four). Stretch and roll each piece into long strings. If you are using two strings, you need to gently twist them against each-other, like two snakes embracing. At one of the ends, curl the dough and form a noose, tying a rough knot. If you have manual dexterity or know how to make braids \u2013 braid the three strings and do the same thing at the end, forming a noose. \n Carefully move the dough and submerge it in boiling oil. If you are, like me, using a skillet to pan-fry \u2013 be very gentle with the nooses as you are turning them as they get soft at the seams.\n When fried and darkened to brown, transfer them to towels so the excess oil is absorbed. When it's time to serve, toss the nooses with sugar and spices or dust them with a mix. Double dipping into the spices is never frowned upon. And this is all that the Hangman's Nooses require. A quick fry and a dip. These treats are best while still warm. These elongated doughnuts also are delicious with freshly-spiced iced cream with    .\n Next tenday \u2013 we are returning to the city of   for a fortress-on-a-plate dish that can feed a small halfling army with ease.\n Until next time,  ,\n Yours truly, Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Today, we are talking about a new subject, at least for yours truly. Candy, suckers, sweetmeats. I am not big on sweets, despite my stereotypical love for all things  .   are a very common hard candy found almost anywhere they have  . Some make them spiced and darkly caramelized, while others like to flavor sugar suckers with dollops of honey and juice. Lastly, some mix edible gum in to make them chewy. Gum also allowed the drops to remain in shape and not runny when exposed to warmth.  ,  ,  ,  , and the   \u2013 they all have various recipes for honeydrops.\n To make this recipe work, I ended up during several experimental recipe runs and ended up with two variants and some optional ingredients. Complicated, but you learn from projects like these. To make them chewy and stay in shape, we will use flavorless gelatine, which is an optional step but required if you want to avoid keeping your candy in the icebox.\n Honeydrops:\n We will begin with chewable honeydrops. Place the honey into a high topped saucepan. I thas to be high, or your honey will bubble up and spill. On low heat, let it cook and steam for at least 10 minutes to evaporate some of the liquid in it. It should reduce by 1/4 of its original volume. In a second smaller pot, heat up   and   juice. Mix it with gelatine and stir it well until it all dissolves; you might add a tablespoon of hot water to make it a bit easier. Keep the mix hot.\n Now, bring the heat up in the honey, and once it starts boiling, put a food thermometer in and watch it closely; do not let it bubble over, and continue stirring it. Once honey reaches 265F, remove it from the heat, pour in the hot gelatin liquid, and stir until incorporated. While the honey is off the heat. Its temperature should've risen to 270F and began cooling slightly. Return to low heat, stirring the pot. Bring it back to 265F and remove it from the heat again. It should be liquid enough so you can stir your spices in ( ,   zest, and ground  ) without them burning. Your honey will be dark in color. \n All you need to do now is to pour your candy into the mold and let it cool for 20 minutes. After this, move the molds into the icebox and let it cool and dry overnight. \n Hard honeydrops:\n Mix together honey, liquids, and sugar in a pan, put on medium heat, and stir until it all dissolved. Prepare a ramekin of water and a brush to clean the sides of the pan off to avoid sugar crystallization. Once dissolved, put the food thermometer in and monitor as the sugar boils. Do not stir it until the mix hits 290F. Remove from heat. The temperature will continue to climb to hit 300F. While the sugar is still liquid, add the spices and stir them in. While it is still liquid, fill the molds and let them cool overnight. And we are done!\n I like to pop a honeydrop in my mouth when my throat is scratchy, or I want a sweet treat. I also store these candies in the icebox as here it's very humid, and honeydrops tend to lose their shape a bit if left out. Package them into     envelopes and keep them for your buddies or portion them this way for the road.\n Be careful not to burn your spices, and enjoy! Next time, we will be making drinks! \n Until the next  , my friends,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  's dish comes from the  . More street food and bread rolls from the Golden  .   are small fist-sized yeasty bread with a bit of sweetness to it and sold drizzled with honey or dipped with egg glaze. To accentuate the flavor, they sometimes are sprinkled with fresh   zest and mint. This recipe is a short one, and you can whip a batch of these sweet buns in just a couple of hours with minimal effort. So, let us begin!\n Dough:\n Add yeast to warm  , let it come to life and start foaming. Make sure the milk is just slightly warm. If you heat it up too much, it will kill the yeast, and your dough will be flatter and denser than my beloved Great Great Aunt Sucretia.  Melt the   and pour it into the yeast milk, then add   and  , and mix until it is fully dissolved. In the second bowl, combine and mix sifted flour and salt. In the third bowl, beat together one egg and one egg yolk until it is fluffy. Now, combine all the ingredients. Add flour to the liquid ingredients one cup at a time and whisk well to avoid lumps. After the first cup of flour, add your eggs in, and continue adding and stirring the rest of the four in. When the dough becomes thick and workable, knead it with your hands for at least five minutes. Cover and set aside to rise for about ten minutes.\n Preheat the oven to 350 F and shape the dough into 20 bite-sized pieces or 9 handfood-sized buns. Brush with a bit of melted butter, cover with a wrap or a kitchen towel, and let them rest and rise for 30 minutes.\n The baking will take 20 minutes for 20 pieces or 35 for fist-sized buns. Gently brush the buns with butter and let them bake. At least twice during the baking, rotate the dish in the oven and brush it with more butter to give it a nice color. Test the buns for their softness and readiness, and if they feel done, take them out and let them cool completely.\n Topping:\n Soften the butter and cream it together with sugar and honey. Use a whisk to work them together until it is smooth. This makes a honey glaze, but it will be sticky and runny. If you want to give it a bit of thickness, whip egg white until it's frothy. It will take you about 5 minutes of beating. \nGently fold the whites into the glaze. Once it's fully incorporated \u2013 we are done.\n Dip the buns top down into the glaze. Make sure both are chilled. If you let the egg-white glaze cool in an icebox, the whites will turn into a marshmallow-like fluff. Use it for the dipping \u2013 this topping will be the thickest option. Glaze without the eggs will quickly drip, so serve it on a plate or in a bowl immediately.\n To decorate this Vilhonese street dish, use a microplane or a fine zester to add some lime flakes on top and decorate with fresh mint.\n The treat is ready and is best when eaten with a mug of hot   herbal bland  . Eating them with hot   tea would cool you well in the sweltering heat while eating them with a bitter black   coffee with some cold cream and caramel will keep you warm on a chilly evening.\n That is all I have for you this tenday, my friends. A simple street bread snack to keep you occupied until the next tenday's trip to the marvelous  !\n  and until the next time,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Dear reader, I must admit, as a cook and a researcher of culinary arts of all Toril and beyond, I am quite used to harsh opinions, food crimes, and controversial dishes that delight some and send others retching into a nearby ditch. However, something as innocent and sweet as   causing a slew of hate at worst or aggravated indifference at best, truly perplexes me. This variety of pie seems to be hated by the inhabitants of the City of Coin,   in  . The tavern called   is located in the  . It is a popular establishment that is notorious for a long line of guests impatiently waiting outside the tavern's doors, hoping for a   signal that announces that a table is open. Melon pies are on the eatery's menu. However, they are ofen seen rotting on the kitchen shelves, unpurchased. Why does the tavern continue making this last kiss dish if it becomes a festering, infesting breeding ground for  ? This is indeed a mystery for the literal ages. It was even mentioned in  's guide to the   that the Master Traveler of All the Realms, published in the 14  century  . If I might speculate on the subject, the locals may find this particular recipe distasteful as the pie is not seasoned with anything apart from a pinch of    . Yet, Amnian gourmands are used to bolder flavors of exotic seasonings and   from faraway lands. Or, perhaps, this particular last kiss saw a rise in popularity at some point and was in high demand for a season or two, only to be discarded and forgotten once the dandies of Athkatla found a new fad to obsess over. I must admit, this scenario is more common for   or   though.\n But Amn is not the only place where you can find this disgruntled pie. They are also made in  , Gateway to the West. Most notably, a well-known sculptor,  , is a known connoisseur of melon pies and the fine company of local strumpets. Appropriately so, his sculptures are quite well-endowed and quite scandalous depictions of  , Lady Firehair. The recipe for the pie I bring you comes from one of Ruldan's confidants, Bawny Bess, a coinlass favored by the sculptor. It has a small but notable variation from a conventional pie-crafting \u2013 caramelization. You will need an overripe  ,  , a bit of     extract, a pinch of Dragon Coast nutmeg, and a simple pie crust. You can use the crust recipe we made for   a couple of winters back. Buying a pre-made and pre-rolled pastry crust dough is also an option and should not be scoffed at. Just make sure to purchase it from a semi-decent baker. Shall we begin?\n Melon pie\n Makes one pie:\n Begin by measuring out the components and separating   yolks and whites. It's good to use a very ripe, if not overripe,  . Spit the gourd in two and scoop out the gooey innards and seeds. Flip the halves over, and, with a sharp knife, slice the rind off. Do not worry about a ring of green flesh on the outside; once the flesh is cooked, it will just disappear.\n Roughly dice the peeled flesh and transfer it all into a large skillet. Add a spoonful of   and two spoonfuls of hot water. Turn the heat on low, cover the skillet, and let it simmer. Eventually, the melon will release water and soften up. If you decide to use higher flames, make sure to keep an eye on the skillet; we do not want fried melon, just softened and simmered in its own juices. It should take about 30-40 minutes. Do not forget to stir the pieces at least once, to make sure all bits are cooked and the butter is spread through evenly. Cantaloupe is done when it's buttery soft.\n Transfer the cantaloupe into a deep bowl and let it cool a bit to save you from spraying yourself with moltenly hot melon juices. If you are planning on cooking and serving the pie right away, this is a good moment to preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Add cane sugar, vanilla, a pinch of  , and a pinch of ground nutmeg into the cooked cantaloupe flesh and blitz them together to thoroughly incorporate. Transfer back into the skillet. You should have a bit over two cups of the filling now.\n Turn the flames up under the skillet with the filling to a low flame, sift a quarter cup of flour in, whisk, and let it heat through. Whisk the three egg yolks in a bowl. When the filling is thoroughly heated up, scoop a spoonful of the filling and add it into the eggyolk, immediately whisking them together. This will temper the yolks and allow them to thicken the filling, instead of just cooking and curdling. Add another spoonful, whisk, and add it back into the pan. Whisk it all together again, and let it cook to thicken.\n Now this part is going to be different from what you can see in Athkatla. In Westgate, the filling is allowed to caramelize on the bottom several times before being baked. The trick is not to let it burn, just cake on the bottom of the skillet. Cover the filling, leaving a tiny crack between the skillet and the cover. Let it cook for ten minutes on a low flame. Check if the bottom has caramelized. If there is nothing caked on, wait another two minutes. Remember how long it took you to get the bottom crust. The filling will be thickened by now, so using a whisk, scrape the bottom and mix all the caramelized bits into the filling. Repeat at least two more times. If your filling is still runny, sprinkle in and whisk one-fourth of a cup of starch or all-purpose flour more; it's an optional thickener, but the yolks should be just enough. Now keep it warm while we work on the crust and the marshmallow topper.\n This pie can use sugared dough crust, short pastry crust, or a simple savory pie crust, pre-made, or pulled from the Turmishite pie recipe in this very tome. Roll the dough and transfer it into a greased pie tin or pie dish. Use a fork and prick the dough and sides to let the crust cook better. Shape or texture the crust edges as you wish. This pie could use a blind pre-baking before filling. A short blast in the oven if you do not have baking beans, or a bit longer with beans weighing the crust down. I went with a brief 5-minute blind bake at 400\u00b0F. It did not give it too much color but dried up the dough, which is good for the wet filling.\n Scoop the warm filling into the shell. You should have just enough. Now to beat the errwhites. Use a copper bowl if possible, or another type of metal if no copper bowl is available. You can also use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Make sure the bowl is immaculately clean and dry. And the eggwhites are room temperature. Start beating the eggwhites, adding in 6 tablespoons of white sugar as well as a bit of cream of tartar to stabilize the foam. Beat them until the whites form soft peaks \u2013 this means when you take out the whisk, the string of whites form a peak, and if you flip it over, the peak is soft enough to slowly wilt down but thick enough to keep its shape. It should take about 10 minutes by hand and a bit less with a machine.\n Once the whites are done, top the pie with them and, using a spatula, spread them around evenly. You can also use a piping bag for this if you want a prettier look. The top will become a soft meringue or toasted marshmallow.\n Put the pie in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the top browns up.\n Take the pie out and let it cool before serving. The filling should be thick enough to hold its shape, and the same can be said about the topping.\n And this is all it takes to prepare a melon pie. It is sweet and creamy, but if you are not a lover of cantaloupes, then this dish is not for you. If you are craving for a variant of this pie with no eggs, substitute them for a half cup of flour, but egg yolks result in a creamier filling.\n That's it for today. Next time \u2013 rolls and fried hack! \n  my friends,\n Until the next  's recipe.\n Juniper Churlgo\n , a city in  , is a strange beast. It is beautiful thanks to its distinct classical Cormyrean architecture and scenic locale. The city is built on a collection of closely nestled islands on the   in  . Stout bridges and a  's web of roads permeate the city and its numerous islands, and, of course, one cannot ignore the fortress on the eastern side of town. But I wholeheartedly recommend tourists and visitors avoid the lakeside island of   and well and one of the central isles, the  . They are infamous for the year-round stench of fish and waste; sadly, the smell travels. Sharmran is locally known as the Fishgut Rock, and I think this says all that needs to be said on the matter.\n Unfortunately, the place we are talking about today is located one island east. The Barrelstone Inn was the place I stayed at during my visit, and we can have a series of recipes derived from the food served there, but today, we are talking about a small bakery nearby. It does not have a proper name\u2014everyone simply refers to it as  . The said \"Mother\" back then was Tanthra Bellbow, a popular baker who ran her own shop on the ground floor of her home along with her three lovely daughters:  ,  , and  . Today, the bakery is still in operation, run by Mother Bellbow's granddaughter. The bakery is beloved for its handrolls filled with cheese and its   handbuns, also filled with yummy goodness. Mother Bellbow's cheese buns are popular the day of baking and even more so in the evening, when the bakery sells leftover buns for cheap\u2014a perfect smallbite for a  's fourth eveningfeast.\n So today's recipe is just my imitation of Mother Bellbow's cheese buns, filled with two types of sweet cheese, just a dash of seasonings and flavorings, and diced dried fruit. All of the ingredients of the bakery can be bought locally and cheaply to make a comfortable profit. Shall we begin?\n Dough\n Makes eight buns:\n The dough is quite straightforward. Begin by blooming the   in warm water. Do not make the water too hot, as it will kill the yeast. Once the yeast produces thick foam and the smell of  , add it to the flour. Mix flour, sugar, and salt. Cut ice-cool butter into small cubes, and while it is still chilled, use a fork to push and cut the butter into the flour until the butter turns into fine little pebbles. Next, start pouring the yeast water in small batches, mixing it into the flour. Using a spatula, mixing paddle, or hands, work the dough until it turns smooth. Dust it with a bit of flour and transfer it to a bowl covered with film or a thick, damp kitchen towel, and let the dough rise in a warm spot for about an hour.\n Filling\n Makes eight buns:\n The main difficulty of the cheese filling is removing all the excess liquid. You should find a large curd ricotta if possible. We will still have to drain the liquid from it, and it can be done in several ways. You can spread the ricotta on several layers of paper towels and let it drain into the paper. Another option is to pack it onto a side towel and squeeze the water out. The second method is the hardest and needs a kitchen towel thin enough to let the liquid through but keep the curds in. The same can be done with mozzarella cheese. We want soft, fatty mozzarella cheese that is not flavored with anything, just creamy, neutral, silky goodness. Use a coarse grater and shred mozzarella. Lay it out on paper towels and press down to squeeze the water. Mozarella packs a lot of water, so repeat it two or three times.\n Now, all you need to do is mix the filling. Combine the cheeses,  , finely shredded zest of a whole  ,  , a single  , and diced dried fruit. I used dried sweet   I had leftover from making   from the  . There is no need to soak the dried fruit in water beforehand, but you can choose to soak it in the dark   to add a bit of punch to the filling.\n Once the dough has doubled in size, break it into eight even pieces and roll each into circles slightly bigger than a  's hand. Try to make them as round as possible. Next, cut six slits on the edges of the dough circles, about a finger phalange's length on all sides, evenly spaced. Scook about one and a half to two tablespoons of filling into the center. Wet the petals with cold water and start folding them over one another, leaving a small vent opening (or a big one) on top. Ive played around with several methods of folding, and petals layers atop eachother with a vent are the best way of keeping the buns from spilling over. Do not forget to pinch the top layers together to seal them well.\n Place all the buns on a greased baking sheet and cover them with a damp towel or cling wrap for 30 minutes or more. You will know they are ready for baking once the dough puffs up. While the dough rises, prepare eggwash and preheat the oven to 350F.\n Generously brush the buns with eggwash and bake for about twenty-five minutes or until golden brown. If everything goes well, the buns will stay together and be ready to eat. Note that they will become flatter and deflate a bit once cooled. But I noticed that none of them burst while baking, especially ones with a vent on top. Also, I recommend doing larger buns with bigger top vents and sharing them with friends.\n Another baked good is cataloged for our pleasure. Cormyte sweets are always welcome in my book. But I can not stop thinking about savory cheese buns, and maybe we will tackle those soon together!\n Until next time,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Have you ever visited the  ? There is a city on the great lake's northern shores called  ; no, it's not named after a type of pastry. A northern city with a tumultuous history of always being sacked and rebuilt. It speaks to the city's folk and their perseverance. One Phlan's greatest heroes and the mother of another famed  ,   was a lover of poppyseed buns baked by a kindly baker  . These sweet buns were a special treat when she was pregnant with her magic-resistant son,  . We can attempt to make Shal's favorite treat today!\n Dough:\n As always, we begin with making dough. We will need two tankards of  ,  , half a tankard of  , a small spoonful of  , three large  , two generous spoonfuls of  , two spoonfuls of vegetable oil, and six tankards of  . Bloom yeast in some of the warm milk and a spoonful of sugar. When enough foam has formed, beat eggs together and mix them in along with sugar and melted butter. Start adding the flour and mixing, working the gluten. Halfway through, add the salt in, and continue until all flour is incorporated. You will need to knead the dough until smooth for good eight minutes. Set aside, cover, and let rise until it is doubled in size. It will take at least an hour, so in the meanwhile, let's make   filling.\n Filling:\n We will need one tankard of poppy seeds, half a tankard of milk, four ounces of butter, three-fourths of a tankful of sugar, a pinch of salt, four big spoons of   preserves, and two large eggs. This filling will be a sort of   filling. We begin by melting, mixing it with warm milk, salt, and sugar. Warm the mix-up and slowly add and whisk well-beaten eggs, continuously stirring the mix on low flame until it thickens. Then finish it up by adding the poppy seeds, but not before you crush and grind them. Alternatively, and I know it works, but it is risky, simply mix all ingredients together on low heat and continuously stir the custard until it thickens. The result will be a thick glistening sweet mash. Chill it down to room temperature before forming the buns; otherwise, you will burn yourself.\n When the dough has risen, dust the surface with flour and roll long bits of dough into a rough ellipsoid shape. Spoon the poppy filling in it and, using wet fingers, dab the edges of the shape and seal them together, gently pressing it to push any air out. Make sure the seam is sealed, and gently bring both ends together into a knot-like shape.\n Preheat your oven to 350F, dust the baking sheet with flour, and transfer the buns. Brush the tops with a bit of melted butter and bake for 30 minutes. If your rolls end up being a bigger size \u2013 bake for additional 10 minutes. Halfway through the bake, brush with melted butter again. When the buns are golden in color \u2013 it's time to take them out of the oven and let them cool a bit.\nThe last step \u2013 put several spoons of lemon preserves into a tiny saucepan and add one-fourth tankard of water and cook, stirring. We want the jam to dissolve into a glaze and thicken so it sticks to the buns. Generously brush the buns with lemon glaze and sprinkle with more poppy seeds.\n And here we go, Shal Bal's poppy buns. Some said she ate them by basketfuls. Lucky woman. These buns are best fresh and drowned in lemon glaze, but they can also last for several days.\n Friends, this is all I have for you this  . And if you have some leftover poppy, make baked  ,  , and poppy roll sandwiches.\n  my friends, and until the next time we meet.\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Travelers of the   are well aware of the small town of   just outside of the city of  , to the east, across the bridge of the same name. Mossbridges hit a renaissance and unprecedented growth soon after the infamous   ended the ravaging of the region. You have to visit the town if you are looking to book a vacation at the most curious destination\u2013 the place only known as  . On my last trip to the Vast, I made sure to stop by the   travel agency and book a passage to the Resort \u2013 the place that is cold and covered in snow in the summer and warm and welcoming in the winter. But that is a story for another day. Today, we will focus on the  .\n The Golden Goblet stood on the main street of Mossbridges' Old Town. Although the menu was somewhat unadventurous, the food and the lodgings themselves were of top quality. The selection of libations stretched from   to   and   drinks, and even offered exotic    . Food on offer was mostly a collection of roasted beasts with vegetables,   fried with  , and a few other things. But today's dish is one of the menu's last kisses- a  , a sweet crumbly pastry cut into cubes, with its middle and top smothered in a mixture of  ,  , dessert  ,  , all crusted and caramelized in pourover of melted  . To no surprise, it was served with a tiny cup of bitterest kaeth and a tankard of sweet ale to wash it down with.\nToday, we prepare a single cake known as the kaeth cake. To do this, we will need an 8-inch cake pan or a casserole dish of the same size and a square of   paper to layer the pan's bottom. Let's begin.\n Kaeth cake:\n Filling:\n This recipe is not much different from other types of cakes found across the  . Begin by combining brown sugar, instant kaeth,  ,  ,  , and a tiny bit of   in a bowl. Set aside. In another smaller bowl, melt around six or seven big spoonfuls of butter and set aside, keeping it warm.\n Now, we will prepare the batter. Start by mixing flour, baking powder, and a pinch of fine salt. Set aside. In a big bowl, mix together the two types of sugar and add softened butter. Don't forget to set aside a bit for greasing the pan later. Start mixing sugar and soft butter with a baker's paddle first and then with a whisk once incorporated. Continue whisking until the butter and sugar mix is light in color and appears to be light and fluffy. It should take about eight minutes if beating by hand and about five minutes if using a mechanical gadget. Now crack two eggs and mix them together in another side bowl. Continue beating the butter mix, adding eggs, about a quarter of the total amount at the time, until all the eggs are incorporated evenly into the batter. Add the vanilla paste or extract and mix.\n Next, start adding the dry ingredients a little at a time. Continue whisking or mixing with a baker's paddle until all the flour is incorporated and the resulting batter is smooth.\n The mixture will rise a bit, so make sure your baking pan or dish has tall enough sides. Otherwise, your oven will be smothered in molten sugar. Lightly grease or butter the bottom of the baking dish as well as its sides. Make sure to grease the corners on the bottom well. Cut out a piece of wax or parchment paper to fit snugly on the bottom of the pan. Press it into the grease.\n The next step is pouring half of your batter into the cake pan. Gently smooth and shape the batter and bang the cooking pan against the table to release any air bubbles. Spoon the kaeth and sugar mixture we prepared earlier, forming the middle layer of the cake. Leave a bit of space on the sides; try not to pile much of it on the edges to avoid that burnt sugar bitterness. Pour the rest of the batter over, smooth it, and bang it against the table. If you want to give it a bit of a presentational boost, use a chopstick and puncture the entire cake in several places, or puncture the batter and make several s-shaped swirls across the entire cake. But that is optional.\n Plaster the last of the sugar mix on top of the cake. Sprinkle with a fistful of walnuts, and pour the melted butter over, covering the entire surface. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F for about 45-60 minutes. The cake is done once the top gets a dark crust, and a toothpick or a chopstick comes up clean when inserted. Let the cake rest for half an hour before cutting and serving.\n Topping (optional):\n You can easily serve your kaeth cake as is, but there are a couple of topping ideas. You can drizzle it with melted white  . Or make a quick flavored kaeth and rum whipped cream. Dissolve instant kaeth in hot water and chill. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients and whip by hand or by other mechanical means until you achieve the soft peak.\nCut the cake into nine cubes and serve a single slice per person. Drizzle it with melted white chocolate or top with a generous spoonful of whipped cream. And that is all it takes to try Ravenaar kaeth cake.\n This   's recipe is quite simple. This weekend, we will try making some hand pastries from  , and next tenday's recipe will be another cake from Ravens Bluff.\n Until the next time we cook together,   my friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n And another   is over, and It is time for another recipe. This tenday's culinary venture is  , the Caravan Capital of  . This walled city is known for its wild revelries during the   festival and many many eateries and clubs. Amnians love their sweet spiced sauces, and this particular recipe comes from the  , a famed club named after the mysterious   of the same name.\n The sauce that is oh-so-popular in the Zultail is called   \u2013 a thick sweet concoction of caramel color flavored with  , and stewed out of a copious amount of  ,  , and  , with pears being the main flavor accent of the sauce. Most every dish at the Zultail was made with or drowned in this fruity mess of indulgence. This recipe is not a secret, and one could simply smell all of the ingredients if seated not far from the kitchen doors. When I visited Crimmor, my favorite was a sort of pastry bowl filled with sweet cheese and sauce, served as a little handfood during a performance. Another notable highlight of shoodra sauce use was a  , glazed with the sauce, mustard, and much bark brown caramel sugar.\n Now, I will share with you the coveted recipe for the sauce itself, a treasure from the Zultail, and provide an example of its use, such as the puffed pastries I mentioned earlier.\n Sauce (makes 3 quarts):\n The next part is very simple. Chop everything, put it in a pot, and let it stew. We will roughly chop mangoes, pears, and oranges. Add them to a pot and pour a drizzle of lemon juice, sugar, and water. We should add orange zest, which contains beautiful oils and a deep orangey flavor. Do not throw away orange peel unused in the sauce, instead, remove white bits and drown it with sugar and let it extract the oils, producing a flavorful orange syrup.\n Next, turn the heat up and mix your spices in \u2013 ground  ,  , and  . Mix well and bring to a boil. Now, reduce heat, cover, and let it slowly cook for one hour. Carefully taste and add sugar, lemon, or spices to your liking. At this point, the fruit will be softened and ready to be mashed, to make it of jelly consistency. There are several schools of thought on the matter. Some like to push the sauce through a fine sieve and then add gelatin or arrowroot starch to thicken it. However, that is not necessary and is not what I did here. \n I blended the fruit together into a thick mash and continued cooking it on low heat, regularly stirring. Total cooking time can be as little as two hours, but as long as you don\u2019t let it burn, the sauce can stay simmering for a couple of hours more. While the sauce is still simmering, when you are finished with cooking, add a full, tightly-packed tankard of finely diced fresh pears to give the sauce texture and a nice appearance. Make sure the fresh pears are heated through, but do not cook it more than that.\n When you are satisfied with the taste and thickness, you are done. Leave the pot to cool to room temperature before putting it away in a cold box. Like all things stewed, these foods taste better the next day, and this is what we are going to do.\n Pastries (makes 6):\n This is a quick and easy pastry. Cut the dough sheets into equal-sized squares and cut a hole in half of them. Place the solid square on the greased pan, brush the sides with  , and place a holed square on top. Smudge one small spoonful of mascarpone, mixed with sugar at the bottom of the hole, and one to two spoonfuls of shoodra sauce over it. Repeat the process for all the pastries.\n Bake in a preheated oven at 415F for fifteen minutes. When the pastries are cooked, they will be light, fluffy, and crusty. Once you remove them from the oven, the bubbled-up shoodra sauce will be reduced, leaving more space in the pastries. Line the sides of the holes with thinly sliced fresh pears and spoon in more sauce and berries. Top with crushed and toasted almonds if you have them.\n To serve, i suggest you place the pastries on a platter with a bowl of fresh sauce for the dipping or spooning more of. Shoodra sauce is a truly versatile ingredient. You can can them ahead of time and keep them for the winter months. Mix the sauce with acid, brown sugar, and oil to make marinades, and add sugar to make fruit glaze \u2013   really like that one. And, of course, shoodra pastries are great to have with a big pitcher of chilled    .\n Now, if excuse me, I need to find neighbors who would like some of the sauce, I can't eat all of it by myself! Next recipe will be from   and will involve land and sea!\n  until then,\n Your friend, Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n And at last, our trip to   is coming to an end with the third and the last  . Silvaeren cinnamon flatbread, obviously, came from somewhere else \u2013 the   and the beautiful northern city of  . As a melting pot of cultures, Baldur's Gate had several types of flatbreads from neighboring regions that have become local staples, and this sweet Silvaeren treat was one of them.\n Just like the two other flatbreads in this series, they are called \"pizza,\" as is the fashion in the Gate. These flatbreads are typically thin and light on the inside. The bottoms are oiled and crunchy, while the top is crusty, yet the dough is chewy and airy. Cinnamon and sugar treats are popular in the Silver Marches, and access to freshly made cream cheese makes this combination of flavors quite common. Dust with caramelized   and add crushed   to make it as close to the Baldurian version as we can.\n Dough (2 servings):\n I repeat this part of the recipe as it is the same as what we made for Calishite pizzas last tenday. The only difference \u2013 you will need to use neutral-flavored oil. Do not use extra virgin-pressed types. We will use a very wet dough that is hard to work with, but if you compare the consistency and texture of your with the illustrations here, you will succeed. This pizza dough is made ahead of time and risen overnight, so plan your day accordingly. Add   and   into the mixing bowl and stir. Add salt and one tankard of water. This part will make you get messy. Work and knead the dough with your hands. Oil them with   ahead of time. Slowly pour in the rest of the water, but make sure your dough doesnt turn into batter. Ultimately, you should have a sticky and wet dough, not a puddle. Continue stirring the dough for eight to ten minutes \u2013 we need all that gluten to develop. You will notice that the dough is still wet and sticky but is getting stretchy. Flatten the dough the best you can and drizzle the top with more oil. Use your hands or spatula to cover the entire thing evenly in a bit of oil. Now cover and set aside in your icebox overnight.\n The next day, you will start preparing the dough about two hours before baking. The dough now looks very light and fluffy. Oil up your hands and peel the dough from the bowl's sides. We will do some kneading again. Pull one side of the dough out and fold it on top of itself. Continue doing that for four minutes or so. By now, the dough is stretchy and warmed up. If you are making two individual pies \u2013 split the dough in two. If a single pie, oil up a baking pan well and place the dough ball in the middle. Gently pull and shape the dough into a rough, flat shape. Leave the dough on the sheet pan if it gets too rubbery. It is soft, so it will flatten and spread itself up. Check on it in 30 minutes, and using just your fingertips, gently push the dough into a round shape. Do not squeeze it \u2013 we want all of the yeat's bubbles there.\n Drizzle the dough with brown butter \u2013 simply melt butter in a skillet or a saucepan and remove from the heat once the milk solids in it start turning golden brown. Let it rest again for 20 more minutes or so while you are making the toppings and preheating the oven. The more bubbles you see on it \u2013\u00a0the better the result will be.\n Topping:\n For decoration: dusting of cinnamon, brown sugar, walnuts, drizzle of honey.\n As stated above, prepare brown butter but reserve about 1/3 of the total amount to add to the topping mix later. But the process here is easy. Simply mix all the ingredients until smooth. Do not forget to taste and adjust the flavor. We want the spread to not taste of   but of the smokiness of brown sugar and cinnamon. \n After you drizzle the dough, put it into the preheat oven to 500F, preferably on an oven stone. Bake the crust for 5-6 minutes. The next step is to smear the cinnamon topping onto the crust. You should keep the mixture warm to make it more pliable, and it will help you not to push air out of the bubbling crust. Place back in the oven and bake for 4-5 minutes more.\n Now, a tricky part. Sprinkle the top of the pizza with more brown sugar and walnuts and place the bread back in the oven under a blast of a   or broil. We want the sugar to caramelize and darken \u2013 it should not take more than a minute or a minute and a half, but make sure to keep an eye on it. We don't want charcoal!\n This Baldurian snack is served hot, dusted with cinnamon, or with a teaspoon of honey drizzled on top. Traditional serving - cut into parallelograms or triangles and served with slightly sweet chilled   or   if you like to offset the sweetness.\n Silvaeren cinnamon flatbreads finish up this year's trip to the city of Baldur's Gate. It is likely not the last time we are visiting the busy streets of the Gate, but for now, we will head south. Next tenday's dish will be from my people's homeland, and I cannot wait to share it with you, my friends.\n As always,  , and until next time,\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Just a few winters ago, I hitched a ride across the   on Master Istel's caravan. I was a welcomed passenger, regardless of what some might oh so dishonorably insinuate. The caravan stopped at a tiny foothills hamlet of humans and gnomes, and one of the things that the caravan picked up was a sack full of something they simply called spice cakes \u2013 little bundt-shaped glazed sweetbreads. After doing some questioning and peeking at the hamlet's kitchens, I can proudly tell you how to bake these little spiced treats.\n \nThere are no secrets, and if you have access to several dried spices and  , you can quickly whip up a batch. For this recipe we will need a half-tankard of honey, two big spoonfuls of  , a single large  , two tankards of    , a quarter of a small spoon of baking powder, a squeeze of fresh   juice, one heaping spoon of  , dried powdered  ,  ,   each, and two large heaping spoons of crushed and ground  . Dough:\n You can safely double the amount of spices if you want a flavor that is as potent as a   kick in the face. Regarding the shape \u2013 this recipe calls for small metallic bundt-shape molds, but if you don't have them, you can shape dough with your wet or oiled hands into small couple of inches long loaves.\n We begin by warming up the butter until it is very soft. Then, add the butter to the honey and cream them together with a flat spatula or spoon until the liquid is of cloudy amber color and is smoothly and thoroughly incorporated. In a separate bowl, beat the egg until the liquid is the same color, and add it to the honey. Mix well until incorporated, then add a pinch of salt and baking powder. Now add all of your spices and crushed nuts into the mix and mix yet again.\n The next step will be slowly adding and mixing in flour. I used a sieve to fist it through as I was adding it in. When both tankards of flour are added, you will end up with brown sticky dough consistency of wet sand. Continue kneading it for about four minutes, and cover and refrigerate it to relax the gluten that we developed with kneading.\n \nPreheat your oven to 350F degrees and fill greased bundt molds with the dough, but only halfway as it rises. Press it down to make sure there are no air pockets. If a spoon you're using is sticky, wet your fingers and smooth the surface as you press the dough in. Now bake for about ten minutes. Then reduce the heat to 125F and rotate the sheet pan or molds and bake for another eight to ten minutes. At eight minutes, take out and test with a thin cake tester to determine if you need some extra cooking time.\nNow let's talk glaze. Of course, you do not need the glaze to enjoy the cakes, but both variants I've seen come with a dried crumbly glaze that gives it that nice crunch. The version number of the glaze is simply made with powdered sugar, a dash of vanilla, a spoonful of jam, and a dash of liquid. All mixed together until thick enough to cover the top of your cakes and to not drip off of them. The second, better option, in my eyes, is made with powdered sugar and eggs. You will need to use egg whites of 3 eggs per four tankards of confectioner's sugar, but of course, you will need much less in this case. Vigorously beat the egg whites until frothy with a whisk, then add a quarter of a tankard and slowly beat it into the mix. Continue gradually adding it in as you beat the icing. You know that the icing is ready when you take out the whisk and the peak that, if formed with the drip, remains stiff when flipped upside down.\n \nMake sure your cakes are thoroughly cool before applying the icing. I colored mine with a dash of   to make it golden. The easiest way to apply the icing is by dipping it and then letting it dry. I dusted mine with some cinnamon just for the fun of it. A batch of Sword Mountains spice cake is considered ready to eat when the icing is dry and hardened; it forms a sort of protective crunchy coating for your treats. Easy to transport or toss several in your bag to munch on as you keep watch at camp through long cold nights. Perfect for dipping in  .\n I highly recommend everyone try these cakes out. They are absolutely delightful, and a little birdie told me they are about to be sold in the city of  !\n Another recipe is recorded for your amusement by yours truly. Next time \u2013 we will make a   meal.\n That is all I have for you today, my dear friends.  , and until the next time,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Some of you might think that   is a common eveningfeast last kiss or even a smallbite purchasable everywhere, but it hasn't always been this way. Before the chocolate trade took off after the Year of the Helm,  , when   in   began exporting   beans to Faer\u00fbn, chocolate had been so rare and expensive that only nobles, kings, and politicians could afford such a luxury. Before Maztican beans, chocolate mainly came from   in distant   to the far east, passing through the towns of   in  , then taking the great   across the  , passing the   and from  , shipped across  . From there, chocolate reached   and the city of  , where it quickly became the height of fashion to dip sugared confections and fresh fruit into molten sweetened chocolate and roll them in sugar, spices, nuts, or crystal candies. Such is the origin of Tantran Cherries, with several varieties existing outside of Tantras.\n As of  , Tantran Cherries could be found in the   and the town of  , home to the famous  . Dalesmen liked their fresh sweet cherries dipped in semi-sweet or dark molten chocolate, then rolled in crushed   and chilled to be eaten as soon as possible. For those who do not like dark chocolate, like yours truly, they used cherries preserved in sugar syrup or fresh cherries wrapped in a   shell or a paste of  ,  , and  . And if no additional layers were made, dusted with edible decorative   flakes. The cherries then were served on a bowl of sweet clotted cream, as is customary in Tantras, or dipped in slightly sweetened whipped cream flavored with a drop of Malatran  . This recipe touches on all of the versions listed above and makes a simple treat that is worth quadrupling its weight in gold. Of course, Maztican chocolate is now quite common, even after the Spellplague years, with exported cocoa seeds now cultivated in several places in Faer\u00fbn, including the town of   in the Vast that specializes in Maztican goods, despite being half the planet away from it.\n Chocolate cherries\n Makes twenty to twenty-five cherries:\n First thing first, we need to prepare the workstation and measure the ingredients. Layer a sheet pan with cooking waxed paper. If you are using white chocolate to decorate the cherries, fold the second sheet of wax paper into a tight cone to use as a paper piping back. Using a knife or mortar and pestle, crush the nuts. Go as crudely as you want, but if you want to improve the look of your cherries, fist the dust and too finely crushed nuts away from larger bits that we will need. Put nuts into a bowl.\n Fill another metal bowl with chocolate to be melted. Prepare a double boiler\u2014a pot with some water will need to be brought to boiling, and the chocolate bowl put over it to heat it with water steam. Use the third bowl to soften the butter at room temperature. Lastly, another bowl to whip cream in if you decide to add it to the recipe.\n Once the butter is soft, use a rubber spatula to cream it with confectioner's sugar and three spoonfuls of maple syrup. This will result in a paste that you can easily work with your fingers. Set it aside.\n Bring the water in the pot to a boil and reduce the flames to a simmer. Place the metal bowl with chocolate onto the pot. Make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Let the chocolate melt. It will take just a couple of minutes. Once it is melted and smooth, add a spoonful of oil to it and stir to fully incorporate. The oil will give the chocolate a nice sheen once it is hardened, but make sure to use a neutral-tasting oil. We don't want the chocolate taste of bitter virgin oils.\n Take the molten chocolate off the heat and gently dip a whole fresh cherry into it. Make sure it is fully covered by spilling some chocolate over it and dangling it over the bowl to let the excess drip off. We are not pitting the cherries to ensure their juices will not mess the chocolate up. While the chocolate is still melted, dip it into crushed nuts and gently press more nuts all over the cherry. Transfer it to a wax-paper-lined sheet pan. Repeat as many times as you want cherries with nuts.\n To make a plain chocolate cherry, do the same, but skip the nut bowl and transfer it directly to the sheet pan to chill. If you want sweeter cherries or are using dark chocolate or tart cherries, take a spoonful of sugar paste we made earlier and plaster it around the cherry. Then, dip it into the chocolate and repeat the same steps. Put the sheet pan into cold storage or the ice box, but do not freeze the cherries. We jsut want the chocolate to harden.\n Cherries that are covered in nuts require no further decoration but plain ones could use some love. I used edible glitter to leave them gilded. Another option is to melt a spoonful of white chocolate and transfer it into a small but tight cone made of wax paper. Seal it in the back and snip the very end to make it into a paper piping bag. Squeeze the white chocolate out and move the piping bag to leave zigzagging lines of white on the black chocolate cherries.\n To serve, transfer the cherries into a bowl and give your guests a saucer of sweet clotted cream or whipped cream with a dash of vanilla to dip them in. I've heard that the cheapest version of Tantran Cherries can be made with sugar-preserved cherries. And alternatively, they are known to be chopped with nuts and added to melted chocolate and hardened like brittle, served with clotted cream, of course.\n And now this tenday's recipe is done, we can relax and plan for the future. We will record Mother  's recipe for a spread made of various roasted vegetables and, once again, will try and smoke some fish like the do in  . But until then,  \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Fair  , my friends. This  's recipe is yet again a simple and quick handfood, both savory and sweet, with a generous serving of spices. This particular treat is from the foreboding land of the   in the east \u2013  , and a beloved dish of the   of  ,  .\n Thayvian   is a hand-sized pocket of sweet brushed puff pastry that holds a stuffing of soft oozing  's or  's     that can be substituted with rich fatty  's milk cheese if desired for a smoother taste or simply if it is the only thing available. The cheese is topped with an abundance of crushed walnuts, soaked in     with just a hint of Thayan citrus,   in this case.\n Despite its simplicity, it took me two attempts to nail the recipe and the technique. One can easily burn the spices, overheat the honey, making it grainy, or not seal the dough properly, resulting in a flood of burned cheese. But when the pastry is ready, it will delectably ooze the spices and cheese out when still hot, or, if eaten chilled, offer a nice blend of tastes and textures of flaky dough, spiced nuts, and a layer of soft cheese.\n We will side-step making our own puff pastry dough as buying it pre-made from your local bakery is more efficient. However, if you want to try making it yourself, I can share my recipe.\n Pastry (makes 2):\n Combine honey and orange juice, submerge the orange zest in the mix, and bring it to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat and simmer it for 20 minutes to evaporate extra liquid. Remove from heat and add the spices:  ,  ,  ,  , red     flakes. Once the honey is mixed and chilled, remove and discard the zest. Crush walnuts. I did try baking with larger pieces, but they end up puncturing the dough, and I recommend you only yo use crushed walnuts. Mix the nuts with the spiced honey and set aside.\n Thaw out and unroll puff pastry sheets. Cut off excessive length and sharp corners, depending on the size of your cheese wheel. If you put the cheese in the middle, you need to be able to wrap it evenly well on all sizes. Keep the dough scraps to use them decoratively later.\n Break an egg into a bowl, add a dash of water, and mix well. We will need it to seal the pastry and brush for baking. Put a large, heaping spoonful of honeyed nuts in the middle of the puff pastry circle or ovoid. Do not press down; be gentle. Scoop a bit of extra spiced honey into the nuts and gently place a wheel of well-chilled cheese on top of the nuts and honey. Put another spoonful atop the cheese. Brush the dough edges with eggwash, encircling the stuffing. Gently pull the sides up and fold over the cheese and nuts. Carefully press two folds at a time into each other and pinch the seams to seal them. Continue folding the dough up and sealing it.\n Preheat the oven to 400F. Prepare a baking dish or a sheet pan in case the pastries leak - it will contain the mess. Grease it. Flip the assembled pastry over and place it folds-side down into the baking dish. Brush it with eggwash and decorate with leftover dough. Cut designs or leaves out of the dough and place them on the egg-washed pastry. I made a simple lattice design and topped the pastry with it, brushing the design with the eggwash.\n Bake the pastry at 400F for 35 minutes or until the dough gets golden and crispy after giving a prayer to your deity. It should not take more than 40 minutes. If your pastries did not fall apart, scoop them out and transfer them to a serving. If you are serving it hot, make sure to use a place or something deep, as Thayvian walnut pastries tend to spill their insides, not to be scooped up with the dough.\n A single pastry is rich and could substitute an entire meal; not like it ever stopped Zulkir Kul from eating several at a time. These handfoods could also be baked in smaller sizes; of course, bite-sized treats will cook faster but are just in danger of leaking like the full-sized variant.\n Enjoy the pastries, and next  , we are returning to   and will be baking some savory stuffed  . Until then,  .\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Somewhere around sixteen years ago or so, the   and I ventured into the  , the namesake of the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr. Even though we just traveled along the   to cross the forest and continue on into the  , one of the Swanmays remembered an old poem:   The legend of the Sleeping Kings hinted at gran booty in the forest town of  , which was on the way. And, of course, we had to stay there overnight. The adventure led us to descend into a long-collapsed dungeon labyrinth underneath the town. However, there was no gold to be found, apart from some coin we haggled from traders for a clutch of giant glass spider eggs looted from a minor infestation we walked into.\n But, If you ask me, the true treasure we found the evening after the adventure, when we spent the night at the famous   inn. Its grand dining room had more than enough space to fill all the guests and entertainment \u2013 a band of eccentric musicians who, frankly, abused pyrotechnics, scaring barmaids. But their   produced the most peculiar sound. The eveningfeast was a success \u2013 a multi-course feast with a simple but delectable last kiss of the night. To no surprise, Master Traveler   sang praises to the Silver Wink in his guide to Cormyr. All through, I did feel slightly uneasy through the entire evening, as if someone's unseen eyes were drilling a hole in my back. A very eery feeling, and I could've sworn a bowl of     even made a sound of clearing its throat. My traveling companions just laughed. I decided not to touch the strange bowl nor any of the tarts. But let's focus on the recipe, shall we?\n The recipe in question today is the inn's last kiss. A type of mint and milk jelly I so creatively called The Silver Wink Milk Jelly, and we will make it together.\n Mint jelly (makes four servings):\n Chop fresh mint leaves and stems as fine as you wish. Alternatively, you can blend the herbs and water to extract every drop of flavor. Bring the water, sugar, and chopped mint to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer on a very low flame for 45 minutes. Turn the heat off, and add lemon juice and sugar. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved. Taste and adjust acidity and sweetness to your liking. Strain or fish the herbs out of the water. While the liquid is still hot, transfer a ladle full of mint water into a bowl, add the gellatine powder, and stir until it is fully dissolved. Add the gelatin to the mint water pot. Drip a single drop of green food coloring into the hot jelly. An especially exotic green plant-based dye comes from the faraway   people of the  , if you have the  . But cheaper options are also available. I added two drops because I like bright and loud green. Mix and let it come to a lukewarm temperature.\n Milk jelly (makes four servings):\n For the recipe, we could use   extract, but, as always, I recommend you use a full vanilla bean. Slice a single vanilla pod from   lengthwise and use the back end of the knife to scrape the seeds and mush from within the pod. Transfer the pod and the pulp into a pot with milk and cream. Add two sticks of   and a spoonful of   liqueur. If you would like to avoid alcohol, use this substitute: cut the rind off of a single orange fruit, but do not cut it deep - the white part of the rind is bitter-tasting. Bring milk and cream to a simmer, without boiling it. Let it simmer to infuse the flavors. Ideally, simmering should take about 30 minutes to achieve maximum flavor. Remove vanilla bean and orange rinds from the milk. While it is still simmering, add a ladle of hot milk to a bowl and whisk corn flour and sugar in. Once dissolved and incorporated, pour it back into the simmering milk. Stir the concoction as it cooks continuously until it noticeably thickens. Remove from heat and let it chill. Once warm, cover the surface tightly with paper or a wrap. Let it chill in the cold storage for about three hours.\n For a quicker version of the milk jelly, you can substitute corn flour with 3 teaspoons of gelatin. This will give the jelly a smoother consistency, but a slightly different texture.\n Check the consistency of the milk pudding or jelly about an hour in. Once the mixture is thick enough to be layered and hold the layer of milk, spoon the pudding into cups for service. Bank the cuts against the table to free up any air bubbles and gently ladle over green mint jelly. Put in the fridge for the rest of the total 3-hour wait and let the desserts set fully. I used nice martini-shaped dessert cups, but traditionally, the Silver Wink served the jelly in glass mugs, nestled in bowls of ice to quicken the dessert's setting as you feast.\n Before you serve, prepare the Wink toppings. Chop several red ripe  , crush a handful of   nuts, and chiffonade fresh mint leaves. Set aside top sprigs to make the presentation more aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, I used mini round sweet wafers that I gently inserted into the jelly at an angle and surrounded with chopped mint, nuts, and strawberries.\n And the dish is ready to be served. Spoon mint jelly and milk jelly together for maximum flavor.\n Next time, more mixed drinks!\n Until then,  ,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n It is time for another recipe. I've been craving something sweet, so I decided to replicate a curious type of pie served by Madame  , who ran a boarding house in   of the City of Splendors. The pie's recipe was from my beloved   and the nation of  . Only some can appreciate the dish as it is not for someone who likes northern sugary sweet treats. Turmishite apple and bloodberry pie is made using  , a fruit of a poisonous bush that has a tart and acidic taste (please see a capable   or a   to help you not poison yourself!) For those who live too far from any bloodberry regions, I will tell you of a good substitute.\n Like with most dough, you will need to make it ahead of time and let it rest before rolling and cutting it, or you will have the same issue I did \u2013 it will shrink and will be much harder to roll thinly. But if you a halfling with a busy schedule and cant make it ahead of time, giving your dough an hour of rest should be enough, but you will need to double the recipe to have enough for two pies.\n Dough:\n For the dough, you will need two and a half tankards of    , two scant handfuls of  , two sticks of  , three spoonfuls of ice-cold water, the same amount of cold   or any other high-proof clear, tasteless alcohol. Cut your very chilled butter into rough cubes the size of a phalange and add it to the flour and sugar. With your hands, squish and crumble the butter, rubbing it into the flour until you are left with a sand-like mix of both. Now start working the mix adding ice cold water and co'wii one spoonful at a time. You might need two or three extra spoonfuls to help the dough come together. When your mix becomes smooth and even in consistency, wrap it up and put it away to rest in a cold cellar.\n Filling:\n For the filling, you will need three pounds of sweet   from Turmish and one tankard of bloodberries. If you are in   or any other faraway place, your 1.5 pounds of tart green apples and 1.5 sweet red apples, and a tankard of tart red cherries. Additionally, you will need juice and zest of one  , four spoons of butter, one spoon of flour to be used as a thickener, a drizzle of a     extract, a glass of   and a generous amount of spices ( ,  ,  , and a dash of  .)\n Peel and core your apples and add all of these ingredients to a big boiling pot. Turn the heat to a medium-low, cover, and let cook, regularly stirring the mix. It will take an hour and a half, but you need to remember to take the cover off once you notice the apples are beginning to fall apart. We want a chunky filling, not goo. If you want to add stability to your mix, add a pinch of gelatin to it and mix thoroughly. Taste and adjust spices and sugar to taste but keep it on the tart side. When the filling is done \u2013 put it away to chill.\n Roll out your dough slightly bigger than your pie tins and matching pie toppers. In Turmish, these pies are decorated with the nation's favorite designs and symbols, but I cut out the glyph of a certain   I met once in  . This is a crumbly and gentle dough with high-fat content, so be careful transferring it to the tins; use your rolling pin to help you move the circles. Place the first thin dough circle at the bottom of a greased pie tin and center it. Use a little bit of dough to press it into the tin gently, removing all air bubbles, especially on the sides of the mold. We will not need to blind bake, so roll it thin, about 1/8 of an inch. Fill both pies with the chilled apple-cherry mix, leaving enough space for the filling to bubble and for you to cover it with another sheet of dough. Gently transfer pie covers onto the filled tins and press around the edges to seal the filling in. Brush the top with melted butter and drizzle some sugar on it. And we just assembled the pies. Now it's time to bake.\n Preheat your cast iron stove's oven to 400 degrees, place your pies in and reduce the heat to 350 and bake for about an hour and a half. Keep an eye on your pies, and drizzle with some lard or melted butter twice before the baking is done. You want your crust to be golden and brown.\n I recommend you let the pies rest for two hours before serving, so the filling doesn't become a puddle on a plate. When serving the whole pie, be showy! Turn down the lights in the room and drizzle highly alcoholic drink into the design; I used smokey-tasting whiskey. Light the symbol and let the flame burn through all the alcohol. In this case, this \"silver\" flame was meant to pay my respects to the Mother of All Magic, Holy  .\n No secrets, just an unusually tart pie with some complexity of flavor. If you ever visit Turmish or even Madame Garah's establishment \u2013 do no hesitate to order yourself a slice of authentic Vilhon taste.\nNext time, we are going to the exotic sweltering   for a spiced stew found nowhere else in the  ! And I can not wait to share that gem of a dish with you, dear leaders.\n We will meet again in a tenday, friends. Until then,  \n Yours as always,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n As I promised, today we will talk about klarvels or ring-loaves. These loaves of bread are quite common and can be found in a lot of southern lands, such as the  . But I've come across klarvels in neighboring lands to the north. I truly believe that their popularity will spread along with merchants and traders. But we are here to talk about a version of the bread from the  . Unlike in other lands where these ring-loaves are savory foods made with dark  , Vilhonese folk liked to sweeten the dough and serve it as a type of crude buy delicious cake.\n You will need fresh berries,  ,   (or orange preserves), and sweet liquor (like orange flavored or spiced rum). To make the cake softer, use a copious amount of softened  . In a bowl, add   to taste. One cut would result in a sweet cake, but if you're sensitive or do not have a sweet tooth, half a cup should suffice. Cream sugar and butter together and set aside. In a separate bowl, combine three warmed-up chicken eggs with an almost full tankard of   and a drizzle of   extract for flavor. Set aside and prepare a bowl of dry ingredients:  , baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt.\n When you are ready, start incorporating all dry and wet bowls into the sugar and butter mix. To thoroughly mix, go in small batches and mix well. When all three batches are mixed, they will form a sticky type of dough that will not be handled with your bare hands. Set aside and chill it to relax gluten within. Now prepare to bake. Take your favorite ring-loaf tin and rub its insides generously with butter. Make sure to get it into all nooks of the form to make sure the bread leaves the mold with ease. If you DO have a sweet tooth like us hin do, dust the insides of the buttered mold with sugar. Lastly, preheat your oven.\nWhen ready, transfer the dough into the buttered tin. Smash the tin several times against the table to remove any air pockets, and smooth the top with a greased spatula. Now it's time to bake. Forty-five minutes should be enough. Perfect time to read a good book, sip some cold   by a fireplace.\n When the bread is done, take it out and see if it is cooked with a tester. If the wooden utensil comes out smooth after piercing the bread - it is done. Put it into a chill place to cull the desert quicker. Meanwhile, mix orange zest and preserves with your rum to soak the bread in later. In another bowl, whisk together thick cream, seeds of a vanilla pod, and some dusting of confectioner's sugar. If you want to add some gentle pink color to the whipped cream, mash a handful of berries in a little bit of water and cook to extract the red juices. Strain and cook to reduce. Cool and beat into your cream mix.\n When the cake is chilled, take it out of the mold, pour your orange mix on the bottom, and put the cake back in so it soaks it all in. Now once all liquid is done, place a plate on the top and flip the mold. Fold your berries, chopped mangoes, and orange zest into the whipped cream and dollop it into the center hole. Decorate the loaf as you see fit; I never had the patience for such things.\n And here you go. A beautiful ring-loaf. When it's time to serve, let your guests slice into the bread and unleash the avalanche of cream and fruit from its center.\n My first dessert dish turned out very well, and I highly recommend you try it and taste the flavors of the Vilhon Reach.\n Until next time and the next dish, my friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n I have a confession to make. I know very little of the   region of  . It feels like every time I skirted the great lake's shores on a ship or traveled with the caravans positively galloping past such cities as  , there were never any stops apart from absolutely necessary. Back in the day, Ankhapur had quite a reputation: a rough-and-tumble city of workers, laborers,   divers, and cutpurses. And the fact that a   ruled the city, the infamous  , did not make me want to visit anymore. Despite the dangers and reputation, I did manage to partake in some local foods. Even in the docks of Ankhapur, you can find street vendors, men and women, selling various bits of food, handpies, and other much messier meals. One notable handfood you can pick up from numerous stalls is  , a variety of  , the size of your palm, filled with gooey   and  . This dish can be purchased in this compact assembly or a looser form of actual   in cheese,  , and egg sauce. But you can't argue that little pouches of yummy goodness can be eaten more easily on the go than on a platter or a bowl of noodles.\n One word of advice before we begin: this recipe benefits from a special mechanical pasta roller that can ensure the noodle sheets are thin enough. You can still roll the dough thinly with a simple  , but the result will be doughier and thicker than intended. To be frank, even with a pasta rolling device, my sheets ended up being a tad too thick, but that is a minor issue to work out on later attempts.\n Bring a pot of water to a boil. Trim any especially thick and fibrous stems from around an ounce and a half of  . If you do not have enough dill to flavor and color the dough, you can add the remaining weight in fresh  . Submerge the greens into a pot of boiling water for just a couple of minutes until the fibers begin to break, turning the greens mushy. Fish them out of the water and drain. Do not be afraid to place them in a kitchen towel or paper and squeeze the water out. Roughly chop the greens.\n Now, to make the noodle dough proper. Make a mound of three tankards of flour and make a volcano hole in the middle. Crack three eggs into the middle and add all roughly chopped blanched greens. You can add the ground black pepper in this step. Using your fingers or a fork, start beating the eggs and greens together, gradually mixing them with the   from the inside of the well, slowly moving forward. Once thick enough, knead the noodle dough with your hands until tough and smooth. The dough will get greener the longer you work it, and the total kneading time should be somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes. If the dough doesn't feel smooth still, continue kneading for twenty minutes total.\n Let the dough rest and chill, wrapped tightly in the cold storage while you make the filling, for about twenty minutes. Once you are ready to roll the dough out, cut it in two, dust it with flour, and roll it into a roughly rectangular shape. Once it is thin enough to be rolled with a pasta rolling machine, lightly dust it with four, and begin rolling it through the machine. Feeding each sheet twice through a single thickness setting is preferable, switching it to a thinner setting and continuing it until the dough is preferably at 1/8 inch thickness. Lightly dust the sheets with flour, stack them over each other, and cut them into rectangular that we will later fold into, hopefully, square in shape pasta pockets. Cover tightly to stop them from drying until you are ready to fill.\n This part of the recipe will sound familiar as we've made soft eggs on the stovetop before. I recommend splitting the eggs and   in two when cooking to make it easier to control: nine large eggs and eight spoonfuls of butter total. On medium-low heat, melt butter in the skillet and, pour in half of the eggs, whisk together. Quickly begin moving the eggs around the skillet with a spatula and jerk the skillet back and forth to continuously move the eggs around. We need to scramble the eggs to a very undercooked stage while they are still wet and gooey but have noticeable curdles. Once the eggs look thick enough, as illustrated in the images, remove them from heat and deposit them into a bowl. While the eggs are still warm, mix them with   (white pepper, red pepper flakes,  ,  ,  ), herbs (fresh  ), finely grated  , a tankard of ricotta, and a tankard of dry shredded mozzarella cheese. Taste and adjust the spices and seasoning. Be careful not to over-salt the mixture; once the filling cools and flavors are melded, an over-seasoned filling will not taste good.\n I adjusted the recipe by adding two thin slices of jalape\u00f1o   on the inside and outside of each pasta pocket for decoration. Feel free to exclude them, but their flavor and heat work well with all the cheese. Place about two tablespoons of filling onto the pasta rectangle, top it with two slices of peppers, and fold the sheet over. Gently push any air bubbles out and seal the edges by brushing them off of any residual flour and pressing them down with a fork. Do this for all the pieces of dough. You should have enough for eight pockets.\n Bring a pot of water to a boil and gently submerge each pocket into hot water. Make sure the water is not in a rolling boil, or it will break the pasta open. All ingredients are already cooked, so you only need to watch for the dough to be done. You will know it is done once it is visually fluffier and begins to float.\n Remove the noodle pockets from the water. For authenticity, generously top them with hard shredded Parmigiano Reggiano diagonally across, with two pieces of pepper amongst the flakes. Quickly place them under a broiler ot melt the cheese, or use a kitchen torch or similar fire spells at your disposal. If you are serving them on a plate as a meal, top them with chopped dill and pour over some melted unsalted butter. If you are eating on the go, shape a parchment pocket to hold in hand, and once not blazingly hot, put a pocket in a pocket and bite in.\n This little street noodle snack might be my favorite treat I've cooked recently, so I recommend you try them for yourself. as always, please play around with seasonings, herbs, spices, and filling to adjust it more to your liking!\n This is all I have for you this  , friends.   and until next time,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n We've all visited Aurora's Shops or at least perused the famous  , which has virtually anything you could want on offer, be you a  , an  , a cook, or just someone looking for tools, toys, or miscellany. One of the ever-popular condiments available for order, brought to you from  , is good old  . Many taverns like purchasing it in bulk for five copper per pint to serve to the guests with some grilled bread or as a fixin'. There are two schools of thought about how one should make their beet relish: some like the relish filled with vinegar, making it taste almost pickled, while others, me included, like flavoring it with  , and light brown  , and even honey. Aurora's Beetroot Relish is somewhere in between, making the beets both sweet and sour, hiding its flavor in  , the roasted smokiness of   and beets, and, lastly, with the added zest of  , a noble root found in north and  . Acquiring Aurora's recipe required no feats of adventuring process, no heists, no illusion spells. You can simply read the ingredients on the tin and try to replicate the flavor yourself. I found a good use for Aurora's Beetroot Relish, serving it in   form on a bed of    , with   for a hint of bitterness, and, if you want to make it presentable to a noble or a royal dignitary, topped with crushed   or   and a drizzle of honey. Breads used for the sandwiches can be either slightly sour, neutral, or sweet, like   (especially good with nuts and honey), or   bread from  , or pretzel buns. Shall we begin? Preparation is not much longer than the roasting time.\n Beetroot Relish\n Makes six servings:\n We will begin by washing and preparing the vegetables. Slice the tops and bottoms off washed beets. Peel the skin and, grate them on a coarse grater and pour out extra juice. Use gloves, or you will end up with red   fingers for a week! Add the grated beet to a big mixing bowl. Finely dice half a   and add it to the bowl. Also, add minced garlic and half of the jarred horseradish to the mix. Add salt and pepper and mix it all together thoroughly. In the bowl, set it in the cold storage to marinate the flavors and for the salt to extract extra juices.\n Coarsely chop the tomatoes, layer them on an oiled roasting pan, and cook them in a preheated oven at 350F for 30-60 minutes at least, or until they noticeably wilt and the skin begins to blacken (it might take up to an hour and a half). Now, take them out and let them stand and cool. You can combine the baking with the next step.\n Pour out all the juices from the relish mix. Now place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and spread the relish mix over it in a thin layer. We want to roast the beets to make them less fibrous and sweeter; it will also unlock flavor in onions and garlic! Roast the beet mixture for 30-40 minutes, just enough to soften the roots. When done, let the mix chill.\n Transfer the tomatoes to a cutting board and mince them with your knife to achieve a similar consistency to the beets. Combine the roasted ingredients with the rest: light brown sugar, horseradish,  ,  , and possibly cinnamon if you want something sweeter. Combine and let chill and flavors marry.\n Beetroot Relish Sandwiches\n Makes two sandwiches:\n '  . Slightly toast the buns and gently scoop some of the bread from the top buns. Fill them with Aurora's Beetroot Relish; make sure to squeeze the relish's liquid with the spnn before filling. Crumble the goat cheese on the bottom, top the cheese with nuts and honey, and  . Close the buns and serve your guests with a chilled tankard of  .\n And this is why the recipe is quick and easy. Next time, we are playing with beets once again, but until then,  ,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, friend. This  's recipe might attract new eyes and curious minds, but more likely \u2013  those who hate anything pickled with passion as this smallbite is indeed made with  . Anyone who travels along the   Lake or along the many roads of   is familiar with   \u2013 an impressively common part of travel rations purchasable virtually everywhere or sold at taverns and bakeries for adventurers and caravaners to stock up on. What is a Belth, you might ask. A Belth is a pickle, a pickled cucumber, be it   pickle,   and   flavored, spiced with hot peppers, or even with  . Generally, large pickles are picked for the dish. The pickles are then wrapped in dry, crumbly dough and baked. Sometimes, they are fried, too, but they can end up in a mess if you are not careful. Pickles are greatly favored in the Moonsea, and traveling around with barrels or jars is not practical. Take them out of the brine, and they dry up and shrivel. And if you are not a  , casting preservation magics costs  . Belths that you can buy and munch on with a tankard of watered down   tend to be baked with vents cut into the dough to release the steam and leaking juices; sometimes, they are also basted with eggwash for a golden brown color. Cucumbers used for them typically are smaller in size. Bigger ones are baked or fried, tightly sealed to keep the juices in and prolong the spoiling and drying on a long road across the countryside or wilderness. Some culinary scholars claim that Belths predate the olden days when the warlord cloaked in flames, who we now know was   the Possessing Spirit, reigned over the Moonsea, and some even theorize that they came from the     who once ruled the region.\n The version I prepared for you is a combination of various Belths I've tried over the several years after the   ravaged the north. The main difference is that I prepare my own hot spiced pickles using mini cucumbers and some hot peppers. For those of us who love the heat, I stuff pickles with pickled peppers and only then bake them. This part of the recipe comes from an unnamed halfling hamlet, some miles north of   in the Moonsea North. The locals grow a special variety of hot peppers that have a deep fruity flavor, similar to what some call haba\u00f1ero, brought over from the sunny  , originally grown in  . These Belths are served chilled after being baked, but are still nice if eaten hot, jsut make sure not to burn your mouth with a spray of hot pickle juice. Serve with a pitcher full of watered-down alcohol for authenticity.\n Hot pickles\n Makes 8 pickles:\n Prepare the pickling liquid by dissolving sugar and salt in water and vinegar. Add herbs and spices to the liquid and transfer to a boiling pot. Add mini cucumbers and peppers whole and bring the liquid to a boil. Then, immediately turn the flames off, cover, and let everything cool together. I kept my cucumbers and picking liquid in small containers, evenly divided, but you can leave them in a pot or transfer them into a jar. They will be ready to eat in about a week, but two weeks is an optimal time for the full flavor. Of course, you can also can them and keep them for years if you know how to properly disinfect and seal such preserves.\n Dough & Belths\n Makes 8 Belths:\n Preparing the dough and assembling your Belths is quite simple. The dough used in the recipe is what they call \"Cornish pastry dough\" on some other worlds. We will need to combine the eggs and vinegar and whisk them together. If you are using vegetable shortening, it gets too messy to work with by hand, but all you need is to combine it with flour and salt. Use a machine or a pastry scraper or just your hands. Crush the fat into the flour until it starts coming together in a dough, becoming grainy. Add in vinegar and egg and work the dough further, slowly trickling in water until the dough comes together in a malleable but crumbly ball of dough. Cover it and let it chill in the cold storage for half an hour or more.\n While the dough is chilling, preheat the oven to 400F and lightly grease your baking sheet. Remove pickles and peppers from the brine and drain them by wrapping them in a kitchen towel and gently squeezing them to get rid of excess liquid. Now you can use whole pickles or, for a little extra kick, make a cut in the pickles and stuff them with thinly slices rings of haba\u00f1ero peppers. Another alternative stuffing that I've tried and recommend is wrapping the pickles in a slice of sharp   or aged Ravenian    .\n Take the dough out of the fridge and split it into two equal pieces. Each will cover four or five pickles. Cut off a generous one-inch or one-and-a-half-inch thick slice of dough. Roll it out on a flour-dusted board into an oval thin enough to just wrap around a cucumber. Now, do just that. Place the pickle on the oval, wrap it, and, dapping your fingers in egg wash or water, seal the edges. You do not need to cut vents in the dough, but I chose to do so to make sure the slices open pickles won't rupture the seals with the steam. You can also use the eggwash to brush the Belths before baking to give them a brighter color, but that is optional.\n Place the Belths on your greased baking dish and bake at 400F for about 15 minutes. They will not rise, so you can pack them close to eachother. After 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350F, rotate the baking sheet, and bake for 25 minutes more.\n When done, let them cool down, but Belths are also perfectly fine hot; just hot juices might scold your mouth. They are good to match with a mug of iced spiced dry   (just not  , trust me), and I made a simple dip of  ,    , dried   and pepper lakes. One might need it to put out mouthburn from hot peppers inside. And, of course, my favorite stuffed    .\n I know some of you will clutch your   at the thought of pickles or, even worse, baked pickles, but pickles are a traditional food in Moonsea North, and, of course, deep-fried spiced pickles from Dambrath or sweet pickles from Lurian are also quite delectable. Even if you are not traversing the northern wilderness, try a Belth. You just might like it.\n And that is all this tenday. Next dish \u2013 garlic!\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  's food is well known to every northerner and probably to many people in eastern and southern  :  , seemingly a simple smallbite of thin medallions, or, in some cases, chaotic shavings of  , cooked, dried, and seasoned to a crunchy goodness. Two main varieties exist: one sweetened with powdered sugar and tossed in sweet and warm   from the south, and the other coated in  , hot spices, as well as some roasted   powder, and   or   seasoning. Some cooks swear by frying the beet medallions, while others proclaim the health benefits of them being baked. I've tested more ways of preparing simple crunchies than I am comfortable admitting, but now I can proudly give you my best recommendations. Please note that no full recipe for Blood-Drops exists, and even the spices ratio used is gone by the \"feel\" and by the \"handful,\" if old cooks are to be believed. Blood-Drops are often served to you at a tavern, where the beets are salted generously to gently encourage you to buy more watered-down ales.   envelopes you can purchase from street carts are usually filled still hot, dripping with oil, and topped with a handful of seasonings. The vendor will then fold the top of the parchment packet and vigorously shake to coat the beets evenly (honestly, the best way of serving and coating, even if the fresh fry produces softer and soggier drops, rather than crunchy). Also, despite the name, Blood-Drops do not come in just the blood red of fresh juicy beets as the color changes in cooking, and one can also use yellow beets, so we will try cooking both: yellow for sweet and red for spicy.\n Spicy Blood-Drops\n Makes four small servings:\n I will list other methods of coking in the very end, but my preferred result ended up being twice-baked Blood-Drops for the texture and red color. Baking raw beets will result in them becoming pale in color, and yellow beets will turn black, but baking them first will keep a brighter and more appealing color.\n Begin by thoroughly washing the roots and trimming off the leaves. Do not throw them away; instead, use them in a salad or cook them up. No need to waste anything in the kitchen. Preheat the oven to 400F, loosely wrap the beets in tinfoil, and bake for about one hour. We want them partially cooked to break down the fibers. The beets will come out noticeably softer but still hard enough so you can slice them thinly.\n Once the beets are baked, remove them from the tinfoil and peel them, removing the root and tough fibrous top leaf base in the process. Be careful; the beets are hot, so run them under cold water every now and then. And, of course, use kitchen gloves! Using a knife, or, if you have the equipment, use a mandoline to thinly slice cooked and peeled beets. If you are aiming for thicker slices that will take a bit longer to cook, aim for 1/8 of an inch; for quicker baking time, go for 1/16 of an inch.\n Lay the slices on paper towels to absorb extra juices. If you are not going to use spices and want them simply salted, sprinkle salt on the paper towel, lay beets, sprinkle them with more salt, and cover with another paper towel. Leave them be for 20 minutes or so. The salt with be absorbed, and extra liquid will be sucked out into the towers. If you are just using spices, as I instructed in the ingredient list, just dry the slices off with a paper towel.\n Place a sheet of parchment paper into a sheet pan and lay it tightly with beet medallions. Don't worry about the space. They will shrink. Using a kitchen brush, brush the medallions with sesame oil lightly enough to coat the surface, flip them over, and brush again. We need the oil to help coat the chips when they are done. Otherwise, you will have to find a way to finely spray them with oil after baking. Baking can be done with a single baking sheet, but the beets will shrivel and curve; if you cover them with another sheet, they will come out straighter.\n For 1/8  of an inch thickness, turn the heat down from 400F to 350F and place the chips in the oven to bake for 25 minutes. Then flip the chips over and turn the sheet pan around in the oven for an even bake. Now, keep your eye on the chips \u2013 they will burn very quickly! Bake them for 10 minutes more, but check in after five minutes to make sure the chips are not burning. Remove any chips that look and feel crispy as you go along; they never cook evenly. For thinner chips - 1/16  of an inch - let the oven cool to 350F and bake for 10-20 minutes, regularly checking and removing crispy chips.\n Once the chips are out, gently transfer them to a bag or container, but do not fill them to the brim; we want them to be shaken and coated evenly. Toss the spice mix in and gently shake, adding more seasoning if needed.\n A small bowlful of Blood-Drops is a single serving. Alternatively, you can just fry the chips in oil, the oil heated to 350F, be it pre-baked or raw. Pre-baked produces a good color, so it is recommended, but make sure to pad the slices dry. Each medallion will need to be flipped in the oil as it fries, and it will be done in a minute or a minute and a half. Do not forget to drain fried chips on a wire rack over paper towels. If you rest them on the towels, the beets will be soggy. However, even soggy beet chips will be delicious when coated in spices. Oh, and for frying, go with 1/16  of an inch thickness.\n Sweet Blood-Drops\n Makes four small servings:\n When making the sweet variation, there is one extra step \u2013 sprinkling the sliced beets in sugar and leaving them to reabsorb the sweetness for a couple of hours. Other than that \u2013 the steps are identical to what I've listed in Spicy Blood-Drops; frying raw is an option, as well as baking raw, but the yellow will begin bleeding black unless you do a two-step cooking process, baking first, then slicing and baking again. Note that convection oven cooking time will be reduced and it will result in better crispiness.\n And this is all you need to know to make your own Blood-Drops, be they spicy or sweet. Net on the agenda \u2013 more sweets, some   baking, and a trip to  .\n Untill nex time,   \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good tidings, my friends. This  , we are continuing our month of culinary exploration of  . The city of Baldur's Gate is a melting pot of foods from all over the continent, just like other metropolises of the  . Recently, pizza has become a popular food in the city, and several types of these   from neighboring regions have become a staple in the Gate. We will make three of them together. All three will have the same dough recipe, so I will describe the steps here and will refer back in the next two entries.\n The first on the list is     pizza that can be eaten savory and sweet \u2013 all it takes is a drizzle of  . In Calimshan, these flatbreads are a very common variety, so, of course, with time, travelers and immigrants brought the dish to   first and soon after \u2013 to the rest of the city. Unsurprisingly, the best Calishite pizza can be found only in Little Calimshan, so get ready for a carriage ride or a long walk outside the city walls.\n Dough (2 servings):\n For these pizzas, we will use a very wet dough that is hard to work with, but if you compare the consistency and texture of your with the illustrations here, you will succeed. This pizza dough is made ahead of time and risen overnight, so plan your day accordingly. Add   and   into the mixing bowl and stir. Add salt and one tankard of water. This part will make you get messy. Work and knead the dough with your hands. Oil them with   ahead of time. Slowly pour in the rest of the water, but make sure your dough doesnt turn into batter. Ultimately, you should have a sticky and wet dough, not a puddle. Continue stirring the dough for eight to ten minutes \u2013 we need all that gluten to develop. You will notice that the dough now is still wet and sticky but is getting stretchy. Flatten the dough the best you can and drizzle the top with more oil. Use your hands or spatula to cover the entire thing evenly in a bit of oil. Now cover and set aside in your icebox overnight.\n The next day, you will start preparing the dough about two hours before baking. The dough now looks very light and fluffy. Oil up your hands and peel the dough from the bowl's sides. We will do some kneading again. Pull one side of the dough out and fold it on top of itself. Continue doing that for four minutes or so. By now, the dough is stretchy and warmed up. If you are making two individual pies \u2013 split the dough in two. If a single pie, oil up a baking pan well and place the dough ball in the middle. Gently pull and shape the dough into a rough, flat shape. Leave the dough on the sheet pan if it gets too rubbery. It is soft, so it will flatten and spread itself up. Check on it in 30 minutes, and using just your fingertips, gently push the dough into a round shape. Do not squeeze it \u2013 we want all of the yeat's bubbles there. Let it rest again for 20 more minutes or so while you are making the toppings and preheating the oven. The more bubbles you see on it \u2013\u00a0the better the result will be.\n Topping:\n For decoration: some shredded cheese, more crushed pistachios, basil leaves, thinly sliced habanero peppers, sliced olives, and a drizzle of honey and/or Balti seasoning mix (all combinations are optional).\n Mash together all the ingredients together. We are aiming for a chunky and dry pesto-like substance. Do not be afraid to taste and just the seasoning. Remember not to over-season it. If you are using mechanical means to make the mash \u2013 you can add in some extra oil as it all blends, but we can't have too much oil in it, or the dough will get too soggy and greasy.\n Preheat your oven to 500F. It is better if you have an oven stone, but if you don't, you can always be sure to broil it for a minute for color. Before putting the dough in, give it some texture. Drizzle it with non-virgin olive oil or  -infused oil. Gently press in the dough with your fingertips one last time to shape it, but avoid squeezing bubbles. Let it bake for 6 minutes. Remove the pre-baked dough and gently smear the pistachio paste atop its oiled surface. If the paste is too hard, warm it up first. Put the pizza back for 4 more minutes. Take out and sprinkle with a tiny bit of shredded cheese (Swiss or young cheddar). The cheese will hold it all together. Put the pizza back to finish baking. It will take a couple of minutes. If the dough still looks anemic, quickly blast it under a broiler. \n Calishite pistachio pizza, as served in Baldurian Little Calimshan, is ready. Toss the pizza with crushed pistachios, thinly sliced  , thinly julienned habanero   (we use them for the sweetness), and chopped  . If you want an extra oomph \u2013 give it a slight drizzle with some Balti seasoning mix. But that last ingredient is optional.\n If you just eat it as it is \u2013 it has a thick, delicious, savory taste, almost meaty. The combination of flavors is superb. But if you just drizzle it with golden honey, preferably from the north, like honey bottled in  , this savory dish suddenly becomes a delicious sweet treat.\n Do not be afraid to offend Calishites and slice the bread as you wish. The dough, when cooked, will be crusty and crunchy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. It can hold the toppings well, so I like to slice them into breadstick shapes (which is also good for dipping into honey).\n Next time, the other Balduran flatbreads \u2013 one with   and the other with  . But until then,  .\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Another   has come and done, and another recipe is here. Back in school, I witnessed a shouting match between four disheveled hoar-bearded sages who angrily tried to convince each other of what is the biggest mystery of the infinite planes. One sage, who wore a   of a Cormyte  , used a scroll of what he claimed was a grossly incomplete list of all known and presumed heirs of good old King  . His thesis was that it was a mystery how many spawn the monarch had managed to sire before his demise, a grand mystery that even Azoun did not know the answer to. The hefty scroll was eventually used as a bludgeon against sage number two. The second one was a chubby-faced geriatric man whose face turned the color of   hot   when his claims were dismissed by the shouting peers. He claimed that there were reports that confirmed numerous   and   in existence across several locales, worlds, and planes, more than a presumed human archmage had possessed in life. The third old man with the graceful body of a freeze-dried  , apparently an   from  , went hoarse over claiming that the great  's prophesies, their source, and interpretation was the greatest mystery in the world. And the fourth one was an angry   woman who wore no scholarly robes but had her beard braided in a way that indicated her as a dwavish historian and theologian of the  . She claimed that the great mystery was  's divine power, and if he and   were to go to war across the planes, it was uncertain if the Dwarffather or the Overgod of   were to come out on top. However, unlikely as it may be, the shouting match started after a kitchen boy asked why Cormytes loved their   so, shrugging and calling it the greatest mystery there is. Little Pip did not care for that particular type of pastry...\n So, I bring you one of the countless types of tarts found in Cormyr: Sage-and-Egg Tarts. These smallbites were often served at the Royal Palace in   for meetings between the Royal Magician, the  , War Wizards, and King  . These tarts were made using eggs and sage leaves, both dried and fresh, and a bit of cheese, as well as a nice crust made with crushed  . They were devoured by platterfuls and were so popular that a version of the dish made its way to   and the  , where they were baked in bigger sizes and called a funny word that sounds like a   sneeze\u2014 . They can be made ahead of time, which makes the job of the castle's cooks that much easier, but they are still delectable when eaten hot. Let us begin!\n Hazelnut tart shell\n Makes 8 tarts:\n This tart dough requires the   to be cold and diced. You will need to add freezing ice-cold water\u2014small ice cubes in it would be acceptable\u2014to keep the dough cold as the concoction is being mixed. Start mixing   and   with diced butter, using a kneading machine or with a pastry scraper, by cutting the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles crumbly pebbly sand. Next, using a knife, chop   semi-finely or crush the nuts using a mortar and pestle. Add the nuts to the flour. Stir, then add a single large eggyolk and, as you mix the dough, start pouring in ice cold water in small trickles. Once all liquid is incorporated, if the pastry feels dry, add an additional tablespoon of ice-cold water. Continue mixing the dough in the machine to disperse the water and butter evenly for several moments, or knead the dough by hand for five minutes, but try not to heat the dough too much, or it will get messy and sticky. This particular tart dough will be crumbly, so be gentle. Roll it into a ball, wrap it tightly, and set it to rest in the cold box for at least thirty minutes. \n Sage-and-Egg Ttarts\n Makes 8 tarts:\n To make the filling, beat and thoroughly mix together whipping  , two spoonfuls of full-fat  , four to five eggs, depending on their size, half a cup of shredded  , as well as a bunch of seasonings: salt,  ,   powder, dried  , and a pinch of  . If you used cold cream and eggs, now is a good time to let them warm up and work on the dough.\n Roll the chilled dough into a thin circle on a board lightly sprinkled with flour. You should have just enough to make eight circles of dough. You can measure them to be a bit over five inches by measuring them against mini pie tins. Place each circle into a lightly greased pie tin, spread it, and mold it into the tin shape with your thumbs. To ensure the dough cooks through, prick it all over with a fork. It lives to give space for steam and heat to penetrate the entire crust. Don't worry about leakage, as the tarts will thicken quickly.\n Roughly chop fresh sage leaves, reserving some for topping and the optional step of frying the leaves. Sprinkle fresh sage into the tarts, then fill them with the egg mixture. Do not forget to whisk the filling again before pouring to pick up all the solids that would have sat to the bottom by now.\n I found that you can pre-bake the tarts at 400F for ten minutes if you wish, but the dough will still cook through in such small sizes. So preheat the oven to 325F. Sprinkle the top with herbs, cheese, and nuts to your liking, and float a single fried leaf of sage in the middle. It's optional, but frying sage is easy and quick. Simply bring frying oil to 350F or so and submerge a leaf in it for thirty to fifty seconds. Let the fried leaves air dry on a rack until they become crumbly and harden.\n Bake the tarts in the middle rack of a preheated oven for thirty to forty minutes. You will know the tarts are done when they start puffing up. Do not worry; the puffiness will deflate moments after leaving the oven. The tard dough will remain anemic-colored when done, but you can remedy that by giving it a brush over with eggwash or heavy cream just before baking.\n Let the tarts cool slightly before serving. I added a side of cherry  ,    , lettuce, and fresh  . Every halfling knows that you need some greens on that plate. And, of course, a tankard of   to go with it.\n I do not know if Duar Obarskyr would like my sage tarts or if   would attempt to turn me into a hog for serving them in such a non-authentic fashion, as the palace's tarts tend to be bigger and deeper, about the size of an individual pie. But I am satisfied with the taste, even if the look might be a bit underwhelming. One way to make them look prettier is to decorate the top once the custard begins thickening ten to fifteen minutes into the baking. Top the tarts and decorate them so the design does kink into the eggs.\n These are all the notes I have on Cormyte Sage-and-Egg Tarts. This leaves us with several more dozens of tart recipes from the Forest Kingdom to make down the road. And until then,  \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n It might come as a surprise, but  , or coriander, was a very popular flavor used in cooking among the settlers of Low  . If the tomes dedicated to the history of the rust blight that threatened to devastate grain production in Netheril in   are to be believed, during the life of the great    , buns made with coriander were all the rage. The three-tome collection of the records  can be found in  , which I recommend you visit\u2014if not for the library, then to try  's cooking and stay in a cozy room that is \"as clean as an   arse.\" Low Netheril was not as lush and plump with magic, so their baked goods were quite simple. The most common wheat bun was made with ground coriander seeds mixed into the dough, and tops were brushed with compound   mixed with garlic and cilantro. However, this recipe is a tad bit different. I followed my best judgment in recreating the bun recipe from several descriptions briefly mentioned in the grain disease historical records. The cilantro (coriander) leaves will be mashed and mixed with garlic and  ; however, substituting them for   would work just as well. Of course, these buns will be savory, not sweet, and can be eaten smothered in flavored butter or gravy. The taste-tester of the original attempt at the recipe was   himself, of the Candlekeep Inn. He was not a lover; his review was a long mumble of profanities washed down by   brew. Little did I know that some   have a strange biological aversion to coriander... But I digress. This recipe requires a bowl of dough developed with  , light fermentation, and much gluten. Start preparing the dough a day ahead, unless you have a friendly baker, nearby, ready to sell you pre-made dough.\n Dough\n Makes 12 buns:\n We've made dough many times so I will be brief. Mix both   and   in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix lukewarm water,  , and yeast and let it bubble. Once it is foamy, start adding the yeast water into the flour whilst adding the oil in small bits at a time, mixing the two bowlfuls of ingredients together. Mix and work the dough until it comes together into a smooth, stretchy ball. It will take about 10 minutes of active kneading by hand. Lightly coat the dough with a bit of oil, cover it, and leave it in cold storage until the next day. Take the dough out of the cold box two or more hours before cooking. Let the dough come to room temperature. Take it out of the bowl and knead it by stretching and folding it for 3 more minutes. Cover and let rest at room temperature. Relax the gluten while you prepare the filling.\n Coriander Filling\n Makes 12 buns:\n Mash two cloves of garlic and saute it in a dash of   until the potent pungentness is cooked out and the oil is flavored with garlic. It shoud take a couple of minutes only on low heat once the pan is hot. Reserve the garlic and oil for later.\n Next, we will combine ingredients to make a filling. Add the rest of the ingredients into a large mortar and pestle, or, if you have a mechanical food processor - you can use that. One-third of a tankard of  , walnuts, two remaining cloves of garlic, smashed; cilantro leaves and soft stems, a pit of dry, sharp parmesan  , and, if you wish for a bit of heat, some   flakes, and another optional ingredient - a spoon of   zest. Mash them all together with about half a tankard of oil slowly added in. We need to make a thick filling, so add oil slowly and make sure the resulting mash is holding together. The chunky texture is fine. Taste, make sure seasoning, salt, and pepper are to your liking.\n Now, the dough is rested. Lightly dust a flat surface and a   and shape the dough into a rough rectangle. Roll it thin, about 0.16 inches thick. Brush the cilantro filling onto the sheet of dough, and scoop and spread garlic and oil over it. Top with the rest of the crushed pistachios. Tightly roll the sheet into a log and chop it into thick medallions, but use a sharpened knife to not ruin the dough and the layers. Place them on a lightly greased baking sheet. Do not cluster them, as they will puff up during baking. Some of the oil will leak out, so dont worry when you see it. Cover the sheets with a kitchen towel and let them be for fifteen to twenty minutes or so as the oven is preheating.\n Preheat the oven to 375F and bake the coriander buns for about 40 minutes. They will get color in the oven, but if you wish for a bit more browning, brush the dough with cream before baking.\n Once done, eat the Netherese Coriander Buns cold or hot, smothered in  , cheese, or just flavored butter. They are savory and quite filling, so no more than two rolls per serving.\n And this is the recipe I had for you this  . Just in time if you want to bake something fun for your family for tomorrow's autumnal festival.\n Next time, we are trying our hand at some sweets from   and some   baking and trying a recipe from the Forest Kingdom of  .\n Try not to burn your mouth on oven-hot buns, and until the next time,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Street food found across the   is, perhaps, my favorite genre of recipes to cover for this little project. Sometimes, the food is simple fried meats and dough sticks or freshly chopped   and fruit-flavored ice. But sometimes, more exotic foods can be found on busy city streets. This  's recipe is whatever they call a   from the City of Splendors,  . Is it made with actual dire chickens? Does the flavor come from the chicken's flesh? Or is it a mixture of three types of pepper seasoning popular in Waterdeep? There are many questions, and none of them can be answered with full certainty. As none of the street vendors were interested in talking about the dish, especially in the middle of a mad dash across a hawker-filled market, we had to experiment and try to replicate the dish as best as we could.\n Dire Chicken on a Stick is just that: pieces of chicken, possibly dire, pounded, skewered, battered, covered in bread crumbs, and dunked into a cauldron of bubbling hot oil to be fried. Once done, the vendor would dip the chicken into a mixture of roasted tomatoes and hot peppers, mixed with a three-pepper seasoning and herbs, and eat. Sometimes, the sauce is spooned over the flattened and fried chicken breasts, and a handful of seasoned and fried chicken skins are served like chips, with the same sauce for dipping. The chicken and the sauce have a slightly spicy and sweet flavor, and if the vegetables are charred a bit before mixing, they have a smoky flavor just made better with smoky  .\n If you are interested in finding some of the Dire Chickens on a Stick, I recommend visiting the markets of either the   or the   of Waterdeep. I also have it on some authority that the recipe was sold to the   \u2013 shady\u00a0  not known for its food, but the good company of entertainers who could play card games with you or provide a more private variety of service. Overly-salty Dire Chickens, however, go well with the festhall's cheap ales \u2013 a classic trick to sell more drinks.\n Dire Chicken on a Stick\n Makes 4 servings:\n We will prepare the roasted vegetable sauce first, and it can be done ahead of time, but it will need to be warmed before consumption. Begin by doing a quick marinade for the coarsely cut sweet onion. Combine the onion with vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper, and let sit for 20 minutes.\n While the onions are marinating, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Add cherry tomatoes and peppers to the baking dish. If you are sensitive to spice, seed the peppers first. Add the onions to the baking pan, but save the vinegar for later. I used garlic-infused olive oil and tossed the vegetables in it, as well as in a mixture of paprika, black pepper, white pepper, and cayenne. Once evenly coated, bake for 30-35 minutes uncovered. We want the vegetables soft, but giving them a bit of a char would improve the flavor.\n Once the vegetables are soft, transfer them into a food processor with chopped  ,   (I used stems as well, but finely chopped), a pinch of sugar, salt, vinegar, as well as the rest of the three pepper spice. Blend the vegetables together, taste, and adjust sweetness, acidity, and spiciness to your liking. The sauce should be liquid enough for dipping and thick enough to be smothered over the chicken.\n Now, prepare the chicken. Start by cleaning off the chicken breasts of extra fat and tough white fibers. Use a sharp butcher's or pairing knife to slice them out. I used chicken breasts with the skin on. I peeled the skin, and we will fry it off later, too. We need to flatten the chicken breasts. Using a sharp knife, cut into the thicker parts of the breast horizontally to unfold the breast into a bigger, flatter piece. Lastly, to finish flattening it, place a chicken breast between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound it flat with a meat tenderizer. Use a wooden or plastic cutting board to pound it flat. Repeat with all the pieces of chicken, but leave them between sheets of wrap until you are ready to fry them up.\n Prepare three deep plates of bowls, one with beaten eggs, one with flour with salt and the same three pepper mix, and one with panko bread crumbs or home-made crumbs from a 1/4  of a loaf of country-style  .\n Preheat a large skillet with flying oil and be ready to brown the chicken quickly right after breading it. Open the plastic wrap and pat the chicken dry on both sides. Sprinkle it with a bit of salt and begin breading it. First, cover it in flour, then egg, and then bread crumbs. Once is fine, but for a thicker crust, repeat it twice. Place it in hot oil to begin frying it off. The oil temperature should be around 325-350F. A good test is to dip a wooden spoon in oil, and if it's bubbling, time to fry.\n Fry the flattened chicken in oil on both sides until it turns golden brown. The chicken is flat, so it will cook quickly and will remain moist. Leave the fried chicken breasts to rest on a wire rack. It will let them stay crispy instead of being soggy. Skever the breasts with 2   sticks while they rest, so you are able to eat the chicken right off the stick or slice them in two for smaller portions. To cook up chicken skins, sprinkle them well with salt, drench them in flour, and fry up at the same temperature until crispy and golden. Let them drip excess oil on a wire rack.\n To serve, simply offer your guests a bowl of sauce for dipping or spoon a generous amount over the chicken. The sauce should be warm, and that is how I prefer it, but some might want to try it chilled. Another option is to smother the chicken in the sauce, top it with cheese, and blast it in a broiler for an entree instead of a handfood.\n Next time, we will plunder a recipe from  , the Mad Mage of   himself!\n Until then,  .\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Brightmorn, my dear friends. This  's recipe is short and pretty simple but a delight in one's mouth. I knew I had to rush it to you so everyone could enjoy this fluffy handfood.\n Master Traveler of all the Realms,   wrote in riveting details about his culinary adventures across the  . In his guide to the city of  , the also visited a handful of nearby towns. One such stop was  , a town on the busy  , halfway between Baldur's Gate and the glittering nation of  . One particular establishment attracted my attention, and I followed in Master Volo's footsteps.\n  is the destination. The inn's building and the establishment itself are old. So old, in fact, that I failed to get any scoop from the employees on its history; most just talk about how some   stayed there that one time. The most memorable part of my stay there were evenings spent in the company of the elderly folk Beregost, mostly retired artisans, adventurers, and even a mage once with a beard longer than he was tall. Its cozy taproom had a heavy but pleasant aroma of untreated wood and tree sap mixed with the fireplace's smoke and whiffs of cooking smells from the kitchen. All guests are treated to several types of delicious handfoods straight from the kitchens, on top of a full menu available to guests and diners. Simple but very welcome foods served by the fireplace are cucumber bun sandwiches and    , and occasional battered and crispy-fried vegetables.\n Today I will share with you the recipe for Feldepost's famous cucumber buns, and we will make some snacks using it jsut as served at the inn.\n Dough (12 large of 24 bite-sized buns):\n Let's begin with cucumber preparation. The ladies of Feldepost's Inn insisted I peel the cucumbers first, but I disagree. I like to keep the peel on as it flecks the dough with fresh-looking green spots, along with herbs that are going into the bread. Use a coarse grated and shred your long and chilled cucumber and spread it on a side-towel. Sprinkle it with one big spoon of salt and give it a quick mix. Leave the cucumber for at least 40 minutes so the salt flavors them and draws out the moisture. The next step is fun. Wrap the side towel around the cucumbers, twist, and squeeze it well until no water or very little liquid comes out. This is important for the dough's consistency.\n Now we are ready to work on the said dough. Dissolve sugar in 1/4 tankard of warm water and bloom yeast in it until it starts foaming. Add the  ,  , and   and  , then pour the   in and a drizzle of  . Work the dough, mixing it all together but try not to squeeze it, keeping the bruising of green bits to a minimum. Remember that the fat content of your sour cream matters. Full-fat sour cream will produce fluffier and well-risen buns, but low-fat will turn them thinner but chewier. You might need to add a bit more flour or water as you go along. The first consistency we are looking for is feathery and a bit dry. When your dough turns that way, continue working it until it smooths out. As it is bread, you need to work the gluten to develop this chewiness. Knead it for at least 5 minutes, 8-10 minutes being optimal. The resulting dough will be stretchy and only slightly sticky. If it is still clinging to your hands, add more flour and work it in. Drizzle the top of the dough with  . Gently rub it all around the dough roll and place it in a bowl to rise. Do not forget to cover it.\n Let the dough rise for 40 minutes or so until it has doubled in size. Form the dough into balls. Twelve large sandwich-sized of twenty-four bite-sized buns. Place them in buttered or oiled baking pans or sheets. Spread them around as they will need to rise again and then will puff up more in the oven. Brush the tops with melted butter or olive oil, cover with loose towels and let them rise for 30 minutes as you are pre-heating the oven to 350F.\n Before baking, brush the top again but with eggwash this time, and decorate with sprinkles of cheese or cut out several strips of cheese and place them on the top. I used provolone as it stays in the same shape instead of melting. A good piece of advice \u2013 place the cheese on the buns 15 minutes into the baking.\n Bake the buns at 350F. Small slider-sized buns will cook in 20 or 25 minutes, and bigger sandwich buns will take about 40 minutes. Halfway through making, turn the pans in the oven and decorate with cheese. If you notice they do not have enough color, give them another brush with eggwash. When the buns are ready, they will have a nice golden color.\n After the buns are cooked \u2013 assembly time! We get to use two types of cheese. Fresh vegetables,  ,  , and hot  , drizzled with salt and pressed between two buns smudged with soft herbed cream cheese. For small bite-sized buns, all you need is to toast the cheese, something sharp and melty, on both sides of the buns, and I like adding vegetables in between them, like cucumbers and tomatoes, with a bit of dill. Of course, anything goes with them, and you can just have them simply smothered in butter and sea salt.\n These buns taste fresh and are especially good during a summer picnic with some chilled light   or dipped in some light noodle broth.\n I do not know about you, but I will be making more of Feldepost's cucumber buns. I might even try making sandwiches using what I learned in Icewind Dale \u2013 using salted pork belly, thinly sliced and rubbed with  . And we will make Feldepost's mushroom tarts another day.\n Well, this is all I have for you this time. For the next couple of tendays, I will be traveling and will try to bring you some recipes if I am able, but I can't promise anything. See you in the City of Splendors, my friends!\n Until next time we dine,  \n Your friend, \n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Welcome back or well met, my friends! I know it is cold out right now, but we are rapidly approaching spring and all the festivals that bring. Most notable and global among them is the   festival, and this  's dish is a common sight in the hands and mouths of festival-goers across the  , my beloved  , and the  .\n We've touched on   cuisine before, and it's not a surprise that this  -heavy snack is made and popularized by the stout folk of the rock. You can always find a street vendor or ten, cutting and frying fritters of  , green, yellow, and sweet onions. All are chopped roughly or finely, stirred into thick cornmeal, and chilled ahead of time, usually on large sheet pans ahead of Greengrass. Their shapes vary; some are round, some hand-shaped, some squares of goodness, or cut into rectangles. They can be topped with  , spreads, and  , as well as other things, like  ,  , and some such.\n The version we will be making is quite simple. The   will be cut into triangle handfoods, served on leaves of butter , topped with  , sweet   spread, herbed melted cheese, and some skewered cheese balls, pickled cornichons and onions, and some smoked grilled baby sausages. Let's begin!\n Onion cakes (makes 16 cakes):\n We will start by preparing mise en place: finely cube celery and mince garlic. These two will go into a large pot with one-third of the butter and slowly cook on very low heat until the celery is soft. If you don't want color on the garlic, add it about 15 minutes in. Chop the entire onion and add it with a dash of salt and pepper and the rest of the butter into a sauteeing pan on low heat. Let onions cook until they are soft and sweet, regularly stirring. We do not want any color, so 13 minutes should be enough. Next, transfer the onion into the pot with celery, and add sage, pepper, dried chives, and salt. I added an additional ingredient here - half a small spoonful of lemon-pepper seasoning. Stir and let cook on low heat for ten minutes more.\n Now add the cornmeal as well as chicken stock and lemon juice. Be warned that the amount of liquid and the cooking time will vary depending on the type of cornmeal you use. For me, it took more than two tankards of stock to reach the desired thickness, and the cornmeal was cooked within five minutes. We do need to be able to stir in shredded hard cheese and chopped green onions, so look for a very thick   consistency. Stir well, taste, adjust seasoning, and cook out or add stock to make sure the cornmeal is malleable but holds its shape when chilled.\n The next step is to spread and chill. Take a baking dish or a sheet pan big enough to hold the entire mix and hold it in about an inch thickness. It is better to go with a smaller pan as the thickness is more or less how we ensure the cakes stay together as you fry them. Drip a bit of oil at the bottom of the dish and place a sheet of wax paper down. Spread the corn mix on top of it and flatten it with an oiled spatula. Press it down well so it doesnt fall apart later. Cover with another piece of paper and press down. We want the mix to cool but not dry, so cover it with a tight wrap over the paper and chill overnight.\n When the time to fry the fritters comes, carefully transfer the chilled mix onto a cutting board and remove the paper. The cakes should be stiff enough to be worked with relative ease. Cut the entire dish into cubes and then slice them into triangles. I recommend you use a very sharp knife so it cuts through onion pieces and keep it lightly oiled to stop cornmeal from sticking to it.\n Deep frying is an option, but pan-frying is easier, so that is what we are going to do. Use neutral, high-smoking point oil and heat it up in a skillet. Dab the triangles with paper to make sure they are dry, and fry them in oil on medium heat until crusty and golden; it should take four minutes per side.\n Let them rest on paper towels to absorb extra oil or on a rack to let the oil drip. You can serve them still hot, especially if topped with herbed cheese and sausages, or chilled, smothered in goat's cheese and sweet, spicy garlic paste.\n I served them with skewers of pickled mini onions, cornichons, and fatty cheese balls; others were skewered with smoked and grilled baby sausages. However, plain, sweet goat's cheese with chives or a dollop of goat's cheese with garlic paste worked best for me.\n As always, I served them on butter lettuce leaves to keep guests' fingers clean. This is a simple hand food or an appetizer and can be served plain, or served in a basket with a rich dwarvish meal. Try it out, and let me know what you think!\n Now what to expect from the next tenday? We will write up another simple recipe \u2013 for a   pastry, and over the tenday's end, we will try and bake bread and make a spread from  .\n Until the next night of cookery,\n , my friends,\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n We have not made any smallbites in a while, and I think this injustice needs to be rectified. There are no better bites than small handfoods,   to oblivion, drenched in fatty  , and smothered in spicy  . Or at least according to a common man from the  . This  's treat is called   and it comes from  's   and is the legacy of  , whose name was immortalized not only as the supposed author of the dish, but also as a contributor to Master  's  . This little pan-fried treat is especially popular among the   and devotees of  , the Mistress of Revels, who visit the town's temple to the  , called the  . Perhaps the most notable parts of the town's culture, especially among those of us who are revelry-inclined, are the Lliiran festivals, which are hosted to celebrate virtually any and every holiday on the face of  . If you decide to visit Hill's Edge for one of these celebrations, be prepared for the  ' stunning acrobatic performances,   musicians, and all-you-can-eat-and-drink hot bites,  , and excellent  . And do not be surprised if an eager lad or lass offers to keep you company overnight, as it is quite customary for these festivals.\n As for the hot bites, they are typically made out of wine-soaked stale bread, smeared in hot mustard, topped with   and  , placed in a hot skillet to roast, but not before being sprinkled with more wine, and served topped with chopped herbs like   and  , and spiced with hot pepper flakes. I have the main recipe for you, which is expanded from what you can find in Master Volo's book, as well as a simpler closed-  version, and I also offer you my comments on two similar types of cheese filling or topping for the hot bites. I like using a variety of cheeses for a complete flavor, and for this recipe, I recommend you use acidic and strong  , like   or  , both to soak the bread in, add to the filling, and drizzle for service. Shall we begin?\n Hot Bites\n Makes six sandwiches\n Firstly, slice the country-style bread into approximately 1/2 linch thick slices. Make straight cuts to ensure they cook evenly. I personally like using  , but that type of dough is hard to cut once baked or fried. Lay the slices of bread on a baking sheet lined with     and sprinkle them with about half a cup to a cup of white wine, depending on how many hot bites you are making. Do not let the bread become soggy; all we need to do is mix it more or less evenly on both sides. You can let the bread air dry overnight, or make the process quicker by drying it in an oven at a low temperature, regularly rotating the slices so they dry evenly on both sides. We do not need the slices to become bone-dry, just slightly crusty, like  .\n We will begin with leeks as there are many to prepare, but it can be done ahead of time. Wash the leeks the best you can without splitting them. Cut them into cylinders at a slight angle, as thick as a human's phalange. Keep all the layers together and carefully rinse them again to remove any trapped dirt. Place them on a paper towel to dry off before cooking.\n Melt two spoonfuls of unsalted butter in a skillet, preferably one that is large enough to accommodate all the leek pieces, over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Do not forget to sprinkle them with some salt. Do not brown the butter. On medium-low heat, cook the leeks on one side for about 5 minutes, or until browned. Flip over and cook for an additional 4 minutes, or until the leek cylinders are soft and cooked through. Be very ginger with flipping and removing them from the skillet, keeping the layers together. Set the cooked and browned knobs of keeks aside to top the bites with the time comes.\n The next step is to make the cheese mix. For that, we will begin by finely dicing three small   and slowly cooking them in a spoonful of butter until they start becoming translucent. A bit of browning is fine, as we will soak them in wine in just a bit. It will probably take about seven minutes on a medium-low flame, or fifteen to twenty minutes on a low flame. Sprinkle them with a couple of pinches of salt and black pepper, and add half a cup of wine. Bring the flame up and let the wine cook out, leaving behind less than 1/4th of the liquid. We want the concentrated wine flavor, not the alcohol. Cook uncovered. Once most of the liquid is gone and the shallots are soft and cooked through, set them aside.\n Start by dicing or roughly chopping aged  , brie, and Munster cheeses. Transfer them to a food processor, add salt and pepper, and roughly chopped  . Pour in the liquid from cooked shallots. There would not be more than a spoonful or two. The next part is important for fans of texture, so heed my words. To save time, you can simply add the shallots to the cheese mixture and process them together into a paste, but this will result in a more grainy filling. It can be fixed by adding dry mozzarella that will bind the cheeses together and create a pull when the bits are sliced. This is less of an issue for an open-faced version, but if you are putting cheese between two slices of bread, consider adding mozzarella and processing it into a paste. Taste, add a spoonful of mustard, salt, and pepper to your liking, and a splash of lemon juice if the mixture needs acidity. Process it all once again, and it's ready. Alternatively, process the cheese together, place the mixture in a bowl, and heat it up (do not melt the cheese), then fold in the cooked shallots into the mixture. Heated cheese will be easier to stir.\n To make traditional hot bites, we will need goose fat, but duck fat is a good substitution. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Preheat a cast-iron skillet on medium fire. Using a knife, spread a bit of fat on one side of a large slice of bread, just enough to lightly coat it evenlycoat it evenly. Place it into the skillet and hold it down with a pot or a grilling press. Once the bottom is golden brown, remove the piece of bread from the pan and assemble the hot bite.\n Firstly, smear more fat on the uncooked side of the bread. Take a spoonful of hot mustard or Chinese-style mustard and spread it over the cooked side. Top it with a generous spoonful of cheese mixture, and top with cylinders of cooked leeks. Additionally, you can mix bread crumbs with melted butter and spread that over the leeks in a thin coat. Adding shredded parmesan to those crumbs is also a good idea for a lovely crust. Place the assembled hot bite back on the skillet, uncooked side of the bread down, splash a light drizzle of dry   and place it into the hot oven.\n Check on the hot bite 5-6 minutes into the baking, and if the cheese is bubbling, dripping, forming a crust on the bottom, and the crumbs in butter are browned, the bite is ready.\n Serve hot in the skillet, toss a sprinkle of herbs and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes on top, and serve.\n If your guests want a smaller size and the bread is too crusty to cut, use cooking scissors to pre-cut the crust where the bite will be cut once it reaches your guests. It will result in a nicer-looking smallbite.\n Another version of hot bites can be made as a pan-seared sandwich. Heed my warning about pre-cutting the crust where the sandwich will be sliced. Smear a bit of fat on one side of each of the pieces of bread. On the other side of the bread, smear a handful of cheese mixture. Adding mozzarella to this region makes a nicer-looking pull. Top the cheese with diced cooked leeks or, if you want to be extra hearty, cooked  ! Preheat a skillet on medium heat and sear the assembled sandwich on one side until the bread is golden brown, reduce the heat, flip it over, and cover to let the cheese heat through and melt.\n To serve, simple cut the hot bite in two, and sprinkle it with herbs and pepper flakes.\n And the recipe is done. A good combination for the hotbite is a  , sparkling light green or white wine, or pale ale.   made by the   of the   is a good option.\n And we are done with the tenday's entry in  .\n Next time, we will be making pork buns from the  ! Until then,  ,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n At last, my dear friends, the very first set of my notes was compiled, edited, and prepared for your pleasure. And while   is still hot off the  , I can share an additional recipe with you. Oeblaun Apple & Sausage Rolls are from the wild outlaw city of  , in the  . The patchy nature of the region means that many of the cuisines found there are simple and filling. Apple and Sausage Rolls could be considered the city's official handfood with several variations available. Still, the dish does not originate from Oeble, nor does it even originate from the Border Kingdoms. Sausages wrapped in pastry are quite common, and there is no reason they wouldn't make their way into Oeble. Despite the city's colorful and diverse population of men, monsters, and more  , all of them found these handpies to be flavorful and delectible, especially after a night of rowdy drinking and fistfighting \u2013 both are popular pastimes in Oeble. The dish is simple, take a bunch of minced wild  , sweet apples, caramelized with a bit of lemon and brown  , spice it up with  ,  ,  , or, hot   if you're craving something that will burn your mouth in more ways than one. Then, the pork is wrapped in dough and baked. For example,   offers these rolls wrapped in delicate puffed pastry dough, latticed and dusted with   \u2013 this is the version we are attempting today. However, such places as  , a less refined establishment, offer rolls baked within a flaky pie pastry jacket, which produces a juicier filling as all the moisture gets trapped inside. And before you ask, yes, some of them are, indeed, rolled, like tubes of meaty goodness.\n Apple and sausage rolls\n Makes four rolls:\n Before we begin, a couple of words of wisdom. Bread crumbs are used as a filler in the recipe and, unless it's a sweet variety, won't add more to the flavor. The filling is on a sweeter side, so use the sweetest apples you can find, and we will need to caramelize them in butter until they turn dark, soft, and sweet. Regular pork sausage mince tends to be lacking in flavor, so I recommend you go with sweet or spicy sausages.\n Begin by shredding one sweet apple and a small sweet onion using a grater. Melt butter in a large skillet and add shredded apples and onions, together or separately, and cook on low or medium-low flames, allowing them to caramelize and sweeten. Do not let them burn; we want color, sweetness, but burned bits will ruin the flavor. Caramelizing might take about thirty minutes. While the caramelization and sausage cooking are going on, it's a good time to take out frozen puff pastry dough and let it defrost in the warm kitchen.\n Transfer the cooked onions and apples into a mixing bowl and add crumbled sausage to the same skillet. We want to precook the meat, so toss it on a hot skillet until no raw and pink color is visible. We do not want to cook the sausages through; baking will take care of that.\n Once the sausage is precooked, add it to the caramelized apple in the bowl and mix it together with some of the bread crumbs (don't add too much or the flavor will be overpowered by bread), ground coriander seeds, nutmeg, and dried thyme. You can also add paprika or a hot chili sprinkle for a bit of spice in your rolls.\n Now is a good time to slice some of the remaining apple. Cut the apple into  -thin medallions, we will use them to layer the bottom of the rolls, under the filling, or atop the filling \u2013 dealer's choice.\n Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Unfold the defrosted puff pastry dough and halve the sheet into two long rectangles. Using the fold as a measurement, slice the folds into eight strings on each side \u2013 we will fold them over the filling. Brush the excess flour from the inside of the pastry. Do the same with the second sheet. You will have four unfolded pastry casings ready.\n Layer the center part with sliced apples and spoon the filling over, packing it tight into the rectangular shape. Be generous with it. Make eggwash and use some of it to moisten the ends of the strips you've cut earlier and fold them towards the opposite side, encasing the filling, one side after the other. Transfer it to a lightly greased or flour-sprinkled baking sheet and brush the top with egg wash. Then sprinkle it with toasted sesame seeds or other applicable toppings. Repeat for all four rolls \u2013 you should have no filling left.\n The final step is easy \u2013 bake at 400\u00b0F for about 30 minutes or according to the instructions on the dough packaging. If you want to dust them with paprika or chillies, do it after the baking is done \u2013 I realized the spices burn quickly a bit too late.\n Let the rolls cool just slightly and serve them still hot. A good, sweet, and spicy dipping sauce would work wonders with the buns, but they are delicious with nothing more.   apples are a good choice for this recipe as they are renowned for their sweetness and size. Along the same note, alcoholic   are a good accompaniment to these rolls.   is a variety you can find in the Border Kingdoms, or you can use something locally produced, like abundantly-spiked Crimson Cider made just southwest of Oeble as recently as  .\n This concludes this   recipe. Please try it out and share your improvements to the recipe with me. And do not forget to pick up your copy of   at a   hawker near you!\n Until the next time,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n As you've probably noticed, I often write about street food, and this   's recipe is one of them. Street food in the   is often filling, fried, heavy, and overall makes the belly happy. The vendors and bakers often use old, stale, or \"past-it\" ingredients to turn them into something profitable and in high demand.   's Past-It Handpies is on the menu today, and the smallbite handfood comes from the great City of Splendors,  , courtesy of  , located on the southeastern corner of The   and  . Back in the late 14  century, her bakery, located on the first floor of the building, was quite a sight to behold: the windows and displays were filled with a variety of fragrant baked goods: buns, roundloaves, and     handpies, as well as smallbites of dough-wrapped   and  . Sadly, I am not aware of the bakery's fate today, and presumably,   herself had passed many decades ago. I do have a fond memory of meeting her once. Strange little woman. She was a small rotund   woman of porcine facial features with tiny black eyes, always out of breath and smelling of wilted  . Despite her appearance, Saeraera was a sharp-tongued woman, fiercely defensive of her staff, especially the younglings. I had a chance to ask her about the smell of nettle, something I am well familiar with, as there were always patches of stinging nettle on my Ma's farm. I eagerly assumed that Saraera's Fresh Loaves sold delicious nettle soups or sweet pies made with sour sorrel and sweet cheese, but no, Saeraera gave me a look that could kill. Apparently, the good plump baker was a worshiper of The Scourge Mistress,  , and wore stinging nettles underneath her smallcloth. As I said, odd  .\n But anyway, Saraera's Past-It Handpies were a product of reusing older ingredients, such as \"past-it\" sausages, fried in spices, and stuffed inside dough pockets with seasoned  ,  , and crumbly cheese. These handfoods were usually available first thing in the morning for just a  , and as such, they were popular among the laborers and early birds of Waterdeep. I tried experimenting with the stuffing and sausages and will share my recommendations on how to best prepare this simple handpie.\n Filling\n Makes four handpies:\n Dough\n Makes four handpies:\n Begin by making the dough. It is similar to what we've done before. Sift the flour into a large heat-proof bowl or a bread mixer, add   and  , and pour in boiling hot water as you stir the flour into the dough. Be very careful; do not use your hands to knead the dough until it cools. It does not take long to come together into a smooth dough in about five minutes of kneading and mixing. Wrap the dough and let it rest until you are ready to roll it out.\n Now, to make the stuffing. There are basically two versions I am covering here today: the first version is made with chorizo to imitate \"past-it\" older sausages, and it comes punch-packed with spices, so there is generally no need to add more when frying. Saraera prepared her handpies by slicing medallions, but I found that when eating, you might end up pulling a whole piece of sausage from the pie. My recommendation is to dice or mash the sausage finely after searing it for a better texture. Also, do not use raw, uncured chorizo, as it will turn into molten fat when fried up in the dough. When using regular sausages, even when using spiced sausages, we will need to crumble them, fry them up, and toss in spices.\n Prepare  : thinly slice chorizo or sausages; do not forget to remove the casing, as it is not pleasant to chew on in a pie; coarsely chop   and finely dice  ; measure out the mashed or strained  ; crumble the cheese, crudely chop the  . If you are using sausages, measure out the spices as well:   powder, smoked  ,  , a sprinkle of   seeds, a dash of red wine vinegar. Remember that seasoning and spices are subjective, and you might want to double the amounts. Taste the sausage after frying in spices to see if it needs more.\n Begin by quickly searing the sausages in a bit of oil. Chorizo will burn quickly, so sear, flip, and remove it as soon as possible. Sausages will take longer; you will need to cook them until no pink is showing. Chorizo will release fat and spices, coloring the oil bright orange. Good. We will use the oil and spices to fry onions next. For the sausages, once they are cooked, turn the flame down to low and remove the skillet from the heat to let it cool. Sprinkle the sausages with spices and toss them around to coat evenly. Put the skillet back on the heat and toss the sausages around to toast the spices and infuse the oil and fat with flavor. Just like chorizo, reserve the oil for the next step.\n Add the onions to the spiced oil and saut\u00e9 them over medium heat until translucent. Add garlic and cook for 3-4 minutes more, moving them around the pan to avoid burning. Add the strained tomatoes, mix, and cook on medium heat to reduce the liquid by about one-third.\n Now, all you need is to combine cooked onions, cheese,  ,   (or  ). Season with salt and pepper to bring out the tomato flavor and mix.\n As we are making handpies, an adult  's palm is the size for the pies we are aiming for. Pinch off a bit of dough, the size of a  's or a human child's fist, and roll out our thin, dusted with flour, big enough to be able to fold in two and be roughly the size of your palm. Have a bit of water or eggwhite handy to mist and seal the edges. We want to seal so that no juices flow into the hot oil; otherwise, your kitchen will be sprayed with oil. Place two spoons worth of cheese and onion mix on one side of the dough and top it with three or four pieces of sausage or three spoons of diced or crumbled sausage. Fold the dough over after wetting the edges. Press the edges together with a fork, roll them in, and press down again, forming a seal.\n I tried two shapes: a half-moon and a round one, and I think a round shape is easier to fry, so we will go with that. Now that you have a half-moon pie, pull the edges towards eachother, forming a round bun. Gently press the edges together to seal and keep it in place. Another note for you: do not overfill the pies; keep them on a flat side to ensure the dough is evenly cooked.\n For frying, you will need a skillet and fill it with half an inch of oil. Of course, frying Saraera's Fresh Loaves and Handpies is done by dunking the pies entirely in oil, but doing that at home is messy and not economical, hence the pan-frying. Pick frying oil with a high smoking temperature. Heat the oil and skillet to 325-350\u00b0F (or until the oil appears to be rippling). To test the temperature, you can use the back of a wooden spoon, a drop of water, or a piece of dough.\n Dust the pies off of any flour and fry on each side until the dough becomes golden brown. If one of the seals breaks and juices begin leaking, dont worry; it will be messy but still tasty. Aim for three minutes per side, but it's better to peek at the bottom and see the color instead of relying on timing, as it can differ depending on the temperature, dough thickness, and pie thickness.\n Once the pies are fried off, let them rest on a wire rack. Do not let them rest on paper towels or on a plate \u2013 it will make the dough moist.\n Saraera's hand-pies are served in a wrapping made of   paper to catch the drippings and filling and a bowl of savory   drizzled with butter,   drippings, and dry  , as well as some fresh thyme leaves. I used the leftover   gravy from another recipe.\n If you ask me, it needs some tomato gravy to dip it into, but that is just me. At any event, my friends,   and until the next time we cook.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, and happy spring. The warmer season is upon us, and even such chilly and moist places like swamps of the   are starting to get more pleasant... Disregard the monsters that make those areas a nightmare to travel to. Bring   and vials of   if you are going to visit the town we are talking about today!\n  is a small village built near the   where rivers   and the   meet atop the so-called Shield, the ridge \u2013 the village's most notable feature. If you visit, make sure to take a walk in the gorgeous garden-shrine dedicated to  , but we all know that the food will be the highlight of today's note. Perhaps the most notable food from Mornbryn's Shield is its  , you know, the delicacy sold for a stack of precious   in big cities like  . Here, however, the moss is cheap and not even dried. You should buy several packages on the way out.\n Remember when we made   from the  ? One of the first, if not the first, entry in this series? Well, if that hearty dish was a yummy morningfeast, this tenday's   is a smallbite, best eaten on a hot day with a pitcher of light  .   \u2013 an apt and somewhat unimaginative name given by the locals to a paste made with  , a type of small fish found throughout the Savage Frontier. Just like the  , this dish is a testament to the unique flavors of the region. The paste is smothered on freshly baked crusty bread atop a soft smear of  . A platter of smothered bread bites is brought to the table to be munched on while you happily imbibe pitcher after pitcher of  .\n Spread (4 servings):\n Before we begin \u2013\u00a0a few notes: silverling might not be available where you are, but we can substitute them for sardines or, if they are nowhere to be found \u2013 with sprats. The spread had a smoky taste, so smoked sardines in oil are a perfect substitution. The smoky taste in them is light enough not to be overpowering. Note that we need 250 grams of fish, not fish and  . We will remove all the oil, let it drain well, and then pat it with paper towels to make the spread as light as possible. Mushroom bouillon concentrate is to replicate the mushroom flavor of the original product. You can make your own concentrate, but if you buy a jar from a trader or from an inn, remember that they salt the concoction. Add the concentrate into the mix in small dollops, mix well, and taste \u2013 the only way to avoid the spread of being over-salty, which is not an entirely bad thing for a beer snack. Lastly, we will add a smoky taste by frying and charring tomato paste if you, like yours truly, despise sun-dried tomatoes.\n As stated above, drain the fish off its oil. Grate red onion and reserve the fine pulp and juice. Add tomato paste to a skillet and spread it thinly, cooking on medium-low fire, regularly moving it around the pan. We want to cook it to deepen the taste and get it darker in color, and do not be afraid of burning the paste; the smoky taste of tomato's sugars will make the spread taste more complex. I added  ,  ,  , and ground red pepper to the paste, but that step is optional. Transfer sardines into a bowl and mash them with a fork. Avoid making it too fine and too smooth. A bit of a chunky consistency is good. Mix all of the ingredients. Taste. Season. Cover and set aside.\n Roasted garlic butter:\n Coat the garlic in a tiny splash of oil, wrap in tin foil, and bake for 45-50 minutes in a preheated oven at 350F. Leave the cold butter out of the cold storage whilst you roast the garlic. When the garlic is soft, sweet, and slightly dark, mash it finely in a bowl with a fork. Add softened butter and mix them together to form a smooth, flavorful compound butter. Generally, I would suggest adding sea salt to the butter, but the spread is salted, which might be an overkill. In any ewvent, serve a small salt shaker for the table.\n Crusty bread (2 loaves):\nStarter:\n Dough:\n We've made bread before, so I'll be brief. Mix together the starter ingredients just to incorporate; there is no need to overwork it. It's good to do it in a container that would allow it to double in size. Cover with cling wrap and let it rest at room temperature for four hours. Then, add the two spoonfuls of flour, stir it in, and let it stand covered for eight hours more.\n To make the dough, transfer the now very stringy starter into a bigger bowl and add the dough ingredients. Work and knead the dough until it is elastic. Lightly coat your fingers in oil and cover the dough's surface. Cover and let rest for a single hour. The dough will rise, and now we will do twelve stretch-and-fold kneads. You would want to add a spoonful of flour to stop it from sticking to the bowl. Wet your hands with water or oil. Grab and pull up the dough, then fold it over itself. Repeat it twelve times. Split the dough into two equal sizes. Place them on baking paper, separated by a fold or a baking pad, both lightly floured. Roughly shape the pieces into loaves. Oil your fingers, lightly rub the surface of the bread to cover it with film, and let rise for one or two hours.\n Preheat the oven to 500F. The bread should be increased in size. Remove the cover and spray the surface with water. Reduce the heat to 425F and bake immediately for 25 minutes or so. The bread is ready when its surface is hard.\n Now - plating! Slice the bread as you see fit. Smother it with garlic butter, then top it with the spread. And this is all you need! However, if you want to serve it all still hot \u2013 lightly brush the slice of bread with butter and thickly spackle it with the sardine spread. Preheat a skillet on medium flame with a dash of frying oil and seat the spread bread paste side down. Two or three minutes per piece should be enough. Now, the bread is crusty on both sides! Sprinkle it with fresh   and serve!\n Alternatively, you can toast or grill the bread and have your guests smother slices with butter and fish spread as they desire. Now all we need is some cold ale!\n A simple river village tavern smallbite is served. I hope you enjoy this dish even if you have no intention of ever going to Mornbryn's Shield, but if you do, give greetings to the local celebrity \u2013    , famous for pulling   out of  .\n And this concludes the tenday's recipe.   and until the next time we meet in a kitchen.\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Hail and well met, my friends. We will be talking about a special but yet so common treat this  \u2014 . A popular palm-sized appetizer or a handfood found all over the  , the  , and the  . Every town and every city will have a cornucopia of variants. But they all have one thing in common \u2013 talyths are collections of toppings affixed on top of a large crunchy cracker.  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . I will make two types of talyth crackers: one with     and another with   flour. We will prepare several types of toppings and several types of pastes to keep them all in place.\n Wheat talyth (9-10 pieces):\n Let us begin with the cracker dough. You will need three tankards of wheat flour, two generous pinches of  , the same amount of  , four spoonfuls of  , and a cup of water. Mix the ingredients together until the dough is smooth. Let it rest in a cool place. Preheat your oven to 450F. Roll disks of dough as thin as you are able and prick it around with a fork to stop the dough from bubbling up as it bakes. Cracker disks or ovoids need to be roughly the size of your palm. Take a small metallic bowl and flip it over, greasing the bottom (the outer part of the bowl). Place the sheet of rolled dough atop, place the bowl into a deep baking dish, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. This is important: bake only in a deep baking dish; it will stop the excessively hot air from charring the dough from the bottom. When hardened, cooked, and colored, remove the chip, butter the makeshift mold again, and repeat. Feel free to make them in batches ahead of time and leave them out overnight. We want talyths to be delightfully crunchy.\n Corn talyth (5-6 pieces):\n Corn is a bit trickier to handle. We will need two tankards of corn flour, one and one-third tankards of water, and a generous pinch of  . The resulting mix will resemble fine clay or sticky sand. We will need to gently roll our talyths one at a time between two sheets of   or    , then carefully transport them to a hot oiled griddle, carefully unsticking from the paper. A flat cake spatula can come in handy. Lightly oil a hot griddle and cook the flattened crackers on high heat on both sides until the talyths are solid and can withstand the weight of its many toppings. They will slightly curl up when chilling, giving them that desirable slight bowl-like shape.\n The next step will the making several types of spreads to keep the toppings in place. We will make sticky vegetable mixes as well as one with eggs and cheese. Additionally, there are variants where spreads are made with cooked and finely chopped oysters, snails, or even  . But those can be a project for another day.\n In a big pot of salted water, boil potatoes,  , and   (or  ). Measurements are not that important in this case, depending on how many talyths you are willing to assemble. Boil all vegetables until they are soft and easy to mash - 45 minutes for potatoes and carrots, but turnips will likely take longer to soften. When cooked, drain and let them cool. Each vegetable type will then be crushed and pushed through a fine sieve to make a fine mash. Waxy potatoes will make an almost rubbery spread, and this is exactly what we want in this case. To make the potato mix, add together salt, pepper, some fine shredded hard sharp cheese, and diced herbs, add some   and incorporate until the mash is soft enough to be spreadable but still holds its shape. For carrots, you will need to spice the mash with smoky and sweet seasonings like  , a dash of   powder, a dash of  , maybe with a dash of   if you're adventurous, and some smoky dried   (red or Aleppo) with a dash of salt. For tubers, you will need to shred them first and do your best to drain and squeeze all water out of them. The easiest way is to place shredded tubers on a side towel, wrap it into a ball, and continue twisting the cloth until all liquid is squeezed out. Add salt and white paper, a dash of dried  , and chopped  . Lastly, to make a cheese and egg spread, hard-boil eggs, peel them, and chop as fine as you're willing to go. Mix the eggs with grated sharp, soft cheese, mayonnaise, crushed and mashed garlic,  , salt, and pepper. All ingredients - to taste, as I know, tastes vary. My measurements are three eggs per tankard of shredded cheese (shred your own; do not use packed or pre-shredded \u2013 it's packed with cellulose and starch). For the eggs \u2013 use the finest grater you have. The rest of my measurements are two finely mashed cloves of garlic per tankard of cheese, two tablespoons of mayonnaise, salt and pepper to taste. A teaspoon of   can be a nice addition too.\n Now we will assemble several talyths. To make a green bed for the egg talyth, cook greens, in my case arugula, in butter and chopped sweet onions until they are soft. To make butter sauce, bring butter to a very soft state, but do not melt it. In a warm bowl over a double boiler, whisk in egg yolk with salt and pepper and a touch of mustard. As you whisk, the yolk and soft butter with thicken. Taste, adjust seasoning, and in the end, spoon atop the egg talyth. Poach an egg. Bring a pot of water to a boil and a small amount of vinegar added in. Reduce the heat to simmer and stir the pot to form a circular current. Break a warmed-up egg into a small bowl and gently add the egg into the center of the whirlpool. Cook for three minutes and remove from water with a slotted spoon. Place into a tiny bowl or ramekin. Use a paper towel to soak in excessive liquid. Assemble. Greens and onions first, egg atop, two dollops of butter sauce, and sprinkle with chopped chives.\n A very similar talyth is assembled with corn in a corn cracker. Smother the cracker with yogurt or sour cream, sprinkle with chopped  ,  place thinly sliced   atop, and place a poached egg. Smudge the egg with a hot sauce of your choice. I used a sauce of mashed red peppers.\n The next talyth will be another simple assembly of rutabaga mash, topped with soft neutral creamy cheese pearls and sweet cherry  . This one is called \u201ca pearl to you,\u201d named after a popular   saying, and of course, you can find these talyths in  , the City of Coin.\n The next talyth is from the  . Local eggs, mixed with famously creamy sharp cheeses from  , and salted and thinly sliced cured   meats from  . A simple talyth for simple folk.\n Another simple talyth of cheese and egg spread, topped with tomatoes and parsley, is something a fanciful eatery in   will try to sell to tourists for triple the price, passing it off as a local delicacy.\n Now, we are stepping into more interesting combinations. If you like smoked oysters from the   coast, you can buy them packed in oil far away from the  . You will want to drain and shop several smoked oysters along with sweet hot peppers some lemon rind, and salt. Plaster a talyth with a sweetly spiced carrot mash, shape it into a bowl-like shape, and fill it with the chopped oyster mix. Top with soft, fatty, and neutral cheese and a sprinkle of smoky pepper flakes. This flavor combination is exquisite, and you can find them in the far-away land of  , where smoked oysters are often replaced with smoked snails or smoked stewed viper meat.\n The second use of smoked (or even fresh) oysters will be placed onto a bowl-like bed of potato mash. Make a rough tapenade of minced  ,  ,  , lemon rind, and a drizzle of white wine and lemon juice. We are looking for an acidic and fresh flavor to cut through smoky oysters. Place two spoonfuls of the olive mix into the potato mash bowl and top with three smoked oysters. Drizzle with dried cilantro, dried chives, or dried dill.\n Another quick talyth is   in oil that is popular across the Sword Coast. A bed of potato mash drizzled with oil and a single sardine sprinkled with parsley.\n The last two talyths are my favorite and will require some more cooking. The easier one is spiced sausage and fried   from the Dalelands. Fry up sausages until golden. Arrange them on a nest of potato mash, drizzle with some sharp cheese, and place fried sage leaves around. To make fried sage, just throw sage leaves into hot oil and fry for 10-15 seconds until brittle.\n And lastly, we will make Cormyrean snail talyths. To cook snails, mix them together with a concoction of melted butter, chopped parsley, chopped  , mashed garlic, and acidic white wine. Place them in ramekins and bake at 450F for six minutes or so. While the snails are baking, let us make some compound butter with similar ingredients. Take soft butter and mix it well with salt, pepper, chopped herbs, and mashed garlic with a drizzle of lemon juice or white wine. Pipe the soft butter in a well onto the talyth. When the snails are ready, carefully spoon them at the center of the butter well. Alternatively, you could shape them up before spooning them onto the talyth.\n That was a long day of cooking simple foods for you, my friends. I hope one of the talyths I've shown you piqued your curiosity. The variations are infinite, and you should try to make some on your own! Try more exotic ingredients or even something sweet.\nNext tenday, we are traveling to the   and the tumultuous city of  . Please join me on the culinary expedition.\n This is all I have for you today.   my dear friends, and until the next time,\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  , we are finishing up our trip to   with two more delectable   that, unsurprisingly, originated somewhere else in the Realms. As a melting pot of cultures, Baldur's Gate had several types of flatbreads from neighboring regions that have become local staples. \n The second \"pizza,\" as they are now fashionably called in the Gate, is       flatbread. These pizzas are typically thin and light. The bottoms are oiled and crunchy, while the top is crusty, yet the dough is chewy and airy on the inside. Tethyr is a forest country, so you can expect this dish to be very green. These flatbreads are topped with cheese mixed with chopped fresh herbs and topped with more fresh greens and sweet cherry   when served. Not a meal, but more of a snack or an appetizer, eaten with a glass of young green  .\n Dough (2 servings):\n I repeat this part of the recipe as it is the same as what we made for Calishite pizzas last tenday. We will use a very wet dough that is hard to work with, but if you compare the consistency and texture of your with the illustrations here, you will succeed. This pizza dough is made ahead of time and risen overnight, so plan your day accordingly. Add   and   into the mixing bowl and stir. Add salt and one tankard of water. This part will make you get messy. Work and knead the dough with your hands. Oil them with   ahead of time. Slowly pour in the rest of the water, but make sure your dough doesn't turn into batter. Ultimately, you should have a sticky and wet dough, not a puddle. Continue stirring the dough for eight to ten minutes \u2013 we need all that gluten to develop. You will notice that the dough is still wet and sticky but is getting stretchy. Flatten the dough the best you can and drizzle the top with more oil. Use your hands or spatula to cover the entire thing evenly in a bit of oil. Now cover and set aside in your icebox overnight.\n The next day, you will start preparing the dough about two hours before baking. The dough now looks very light and fluffy. Oil up your hands and peel the dough from the bowl's sides. We will do some kneading again. Pull one side of the dough out and fold it on top of itself. Continue doing that for four minutes or so. By now, the dough is stretchy and warmed up. If you are making two individual pies \u2013 split the dough in two. If a single pie, oil up a baking pan well and place the dough ball in the middle. Gently pull and shape the dough into a rough, flat shape. Leave the dough on the sheet pan if it gets too rubbery. It is soft, so it will flatten and spread itself up. Check on it in 30 minutes, and using just your fingertips, gently push the dough into a round shape. Do not squeeze it \u2013 we want all of the yeast's bubbles there.\n Drizzle the dough with  , infused with  , and flavored with lemon peel. The peel will accent the cheese's and herbs' taste well. Let it rest again for 20 more minutes or so while you are making the toppings and preheating the oven. The more bubbles you see on it \u2013\u00a0the better the result will be.\n Topping:\n For decoration: sliced cherry tomatoes, basil leaves, and roughly chopped or torn parsley and green onions. Optionally \u2013 brush the crust with pepper-infused oil.\n You have to use freshly shredded cheese to make sure it melts well. I am using a combination of soft and hard cheeses to limit their oiliness because we do not want to have greasy flatbread. Mix all ingredients well. Taste and make sure the amount of salt is what you like. You can add dried hot pepper or dried herbs to the mix. Garlic needs to be pushed through a fine grater. We need garlic paste instead of it being minced.\n Preheat your oven to 500F. It is better if you have an oven stone, but if you don't, you can always be sure to broil it for a minute for color. Let it bake for 7 minutes. Remove the pre-baked dough and gently drizzle it with the herb and cheese mixture. Put the pizza back for 3 more minutes. Take out when the cheese turns gold, yet the herbs are still green.\n This Baldurian snack is served hot, sprinkled with additional chopped fresh herbs, and decorated with fresh   and cherry tomatoes. Fresh herbs will add to the flavor, and fresh tomatoes will cut through the cheese and crusty dough. \n In Tethyr, these flatbreads are cut into cubes or triangles, depending on the pan they are baked in, and never are eaten without a pitcher of young green wine. However, in the Gate, it is more popular with almost any type of white wine clarry, acidic, and sweetened with   or some light  . I could recommend a nice vintage of     to go with a Tethyrian Herb and Cheese Pizza.\n This is all I have for you this tenday. Next \u2013 the last of the trio of flatbreads from the Gate \u2013      .\n Yours truly,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n A simple tavern grub is on the menu this  .   handpies in their many forms can be found served as a meal or a snack alongside a pitcher of cheap, probably watered-down  . Most of the handpies you can find are made with mystery meats, scraps, or  , with old  , vegetables, and, more commonly, various tubers used to stretch the meat. This means most handpies filled with mostly quality beef or   cost a handful   more. Beef handpies are, indeed, a staple of the  's menu and, at least according to the advertisement so generously paid for by  , the proprietor himself, are never stretched and are made with actual beef. However, the dough in which the meat is packed differs quite drastically and regularly. Most days, the dough used by the kitchen staff is simple water and flour mix, but often enough, the cooks use scraps and leftover dough from various pies, flatbreads, and pastries. Reuse, recycle, don't waste anything \u2013 every successful inn's and tavern's motto.\n This is why my recipe cuts a corner and uses pre-made fluffy pastry dough instead of spending an entire day making my own or resorting to a simple two-ingredient dough, which we've already made a few times. For the filling, we shall use minced beef, a bit of   and  , rich sweet red  , which can be substituted for beef stock,  , and, lastly, some bred slurry to make the filling silky.\n Beef Handpies\nMakes eight pies:\n Begin by searing minced meat on medium-high heat, breaking the mince apart, crumbling, and tossing it around until it all browns. As you continue frying, pour out excess fat and meat juices, we shan't need them this time. Don't be afraid to have browned meat stuck to the skillet; it only adds flavor; we will soon deglaze it. Now add half a tankard of sweet, strong port wine to deglaze and cook the alcohol out. Scrape the fond from the bottom of a skillet. Using beef stock by itself or a stock and port mixture is a valid substitution if the flavor is not to your liking. Bring the heat to high and simmer the liquids and reduce them at least by half; next, grated garlic and diced onions to the pan, along with herbs and spices, and Worcestershire Sauce. Stir the ingredients in and cook them on medium-low heat until the onions soften. While the filling is bubbling away and is reducing, take two slices of white bread, most types would work, as long as you are not using sweet or sweetened pre-sliced bread. Cut off the crust and blend the bread with 1/4 tankard of wine, stock, or water until it forms a slurry that will be out thickener. Other thickener options are just flour, cornstarch slurry, or even boiled potatoes pulverized into a fine mash. Add the slurry into the filling and continue simmering and reducing until the filling feels thick. Set aside and let it cool. When it's cooled, stir the shredded cheese into the filling.\n Next, prepare the dough. Flatten the sheets and slightly roll them out to make the dough thinner. Cut each sheet of dough into four squares. Spoon a handful of filling into one side of the square and fold the dough over, forming a triangle. Use eggs from the eggwash to moisten the seams and firmly press them together to seal tight. It is important to cut three wide slits on the top to stop the seams from splitting.\n Optionally, quickly toast some sesame seeds on a medium-flame skillet with no fat. Two minutes toasting, then tossing the seeds around and toasting for two more. Use the toasted seeds to sprinkle over the handpies right after brushing them with eggwash so they stick.\n Preheat the oven to 400F, then bake the handpies on a sheet of foil straight on the rack to make sure the bottom and top cook through. Continue baking for about 20 minutes.\n Don't be stressed if your buns split and pour innards out; the handpies are still very much edible, especially with a pitcher of ale. Enjoy the serving of pies, and if you know the    , cast it. Durnan will not miss that barrel of\u00a0  anyway, and it goes well with a platter full of beef handpies.\n This is all for this tenday's recipe. Next time, we will make another mixed drink and try to prepare a soup from the   just outside of  .\n Until then,  , my friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  's smallbite dish brings us back to the  \u2014the Kingdom of  . Its capital, of all places,  , The Carpet City, or just Zaz, for short. During my first visit to Zaz, a tavern of note for me was an unnamed drinking hole in the   that locals just call \"the Hole.\" Despite its name, it was not a   or a   establishment but a   one. It is an eatery that mostly serves local brews and spirits with an occasional overpriced   from up north. Uncommon for the dwarvish cuisine found further inland, \"the Hole\" is famed for its dishes made with   that are known to inhabit the region. I was served a dish made of giant shrimp, cooked in tomatoes and  , diced up and stuffed in a large pocket made out of bread, with some  ,  , and greens. When asking the staff about the dish, they all insisted that by no means is the horseradish shrimp a dwarvish dish, but that it is simply popular among   and   alike. Here is my attempt at reimagining the dish using mundane shrimp cooked and made into a nice tavern smallbite with a zesty kick. The same or almost the same recipe as we are using for the shrimp can be made into a punchy dipping sauce for those who like to skewer their own crustaceans and grill them over one of the Hole's tableside grill burners. This recipe has a bit in common with   and   shrimp we made earlier in the year, but using a superheated broiler instead of a grill. Shall we begin?\n Zaz horseradish shrimp\n Makes eight generous servings:\n Equipment: bamboo skewers\n Simple recipe that would require mixing and cooking, and not much else. The first step is an optional one: once you shell and devein your shrimp, you can sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and oil and marinade them overnight, but typical preparation is straightforward \u2013 all you will need to do is to dry the prepared shrimp with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and paper just before covering them in the sauce.\n Next, we will prepare the cooking sauce and, later, a similar recipe for a more liquid version of it used as a sauce or relish. Begin by peeling the horseradish root and, using the fine side of your grater, push half a cup worth of horseradish through it. Simply combine all the ingredients, reserving a tablespoon of oil for cooking. Mix everything and taste. We want a punchy paste of horseradish and both sweetness and acidity of the tomato. The sauce will have a bit of spiciness from red pepper paste. If you feel the sauce is too watery, add a bit more tomato paste to it. We want the sauce to be thick enough to cling to the shrimp. However, after adding more tomato paste, you will have to taste and adjust the seasoning again. For the best result, allow the sauce to marry the flavors, so let it be for a couple of hours in the cold storage.\n Turn on the broiler. If your oven's broiler is at the top, move the oven shelf up. Brush the baking sheet with one spoonful of oil you reserved. You do not have to use skewers for cooking, but they make it so much easier to flip the shrimp over midway through cooking. Brush the horseradish sauce over the skewered shrimp, but dont plaster them in it; we want the shrimp to broil, not boil.\n Test your broiler's strength first, if it is your first time, by cooking a single shrimp. When you are ready, put the baking sheet with dressed shrimp under the broiler and cook them for 2-3 minutes per side. Do not cook them for longer than 8 minutes, or you will end up with rubber crustaceans.\n Once done, either serve the shrimp, still covered in cooked sauce, on skewers or remove them, allowing guests to dip them into the sauce of oil one at a time or add them to a  .\n Horseradish relish\n Makes eight sandwich servings or two dipping sauce servings:\n The dipping sauce or relish is very similar to what we've done above for the shrimp. Combine all of the ingredients taste, adjust the flavor to your liking, and let the flavors marinate in cold storage. It is to be served chilled.\n Sandwiches\n Makes eight generous servings:\n These buns do not require to be toasted as we want the bread to absorb the horseradish relish. Smother about two spoonfuls of relish onto the sandwich's top bun. Layer the bottom with thin tomato slices, lettuce leaves, and four to six broiled shrimp, and toss some   over. Close the buns and enjoy. You could replace the horseradish relish, if you think that is too much zest for one bite, with homemade mayonnaise flavored with lemon juice, mashed capers, and lemon zest.\n And we are done. Serve these smallbites to your dwarf guests with a tankard of Zaz ale or any libation that can be served chilled. Perfect for the summer months.\n Have a lovely rest of your day, my friends,\n \n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n Hail and well met, dear reader. Be it the first time you laid your eyes on this compendium or a returning lover of all things edible, welcome. If you've ever visited   or perused  , you probably came across blackbread. Dark, crusty, and flavorful loaves common in   and the  . Bread so good, a whole loaf is priced at three whole  . But you can save   by baking it at home and saving several loaves for later. Let us begin.\n Bread: \n You will need a tankard and a half of finely ground    , the same amount of dark coarse rye flour, plus a bit more wheat flour for dusting and consistency adjustment. You will also need one and one-fourth tankards of dark   (preferably one of those fanciful drinks from  ), three big spoonfuls of    , two spoonfuls of melted  , two spoonfuls of apple cider vinegar, three heaping spoonfuls of   seeds, one spoon of   seeds or ground fennel, a pinch of  , and a pinch of  .\n As always, first thing first, you need to wake up the  . Mix one-fourth of a tankard of warm water with a package of yeast and a generous pinch of sugar, mix, and set aside in a warm place; when you see that the yeast has produced foam, time to make the dough.\n Simply mix all of the ingredients listed above with yeast water. Start with adding flours in and mixing; when the mixture slightly thickens, add vinegar and seeds. Continue working the dough for ten minutes or so. It will be wet, sticky, and hard to handle. If the dough doesn't hold its shape, add wheat flour in a bit at a time until you can shape the dough into a ball. Cover and put away in a chilled place for an hour at least an hour. The dough will need to begin to rise but expect some of the liquid to appear at the bottom of the dough.\n When chilled, preheat your oven to 425F. While it's heating up, take out your dough and knead it for three more minutes, incorporating the liquid at the bottom of the bowl back in. While the dough is still cold, it's easier to work with. Shape it into a desired form \u2013 a round loaf or oblong shape. Dust the bottom of your baking dish with flour and the top of your bread. Transfer the loaf to the baking dish and make cuts on top. These cuts are not just decorative; they also ensure your bread will not rise out of shape when baked. Round loaves receive a cross-cut, while oblong loaves get slanted short cuts at the center going along the length or one long cut lengthwise at the center.\n Bake for twenty minutes, reduce the heat to 350F, and bake for thirty more minutes. You will know that bread is ready when its outside has a nice hard crust. You can test the bread like you test cake. The biggest challenge is ensuring the insides are not wet and are thoroughly cooked.\n Take the loaf out and let it cool before cutting in. Of course, I don't need to tell you how to eat your bread, but some of the ways I've seen it served at inns and taverns include being smothered in butter, topped with   and  , topped with butter and honey, various  , hard crumbly cheese with herbs and  , and lastly, with  , slowly cooked in butter for several hours until it is soft and sweet, mashed with salt and pepper, when served on blackbread \u2013 sprinkled with coarse sea salt crystals.\n And there we have it. Another simple recipe that might have to go into the \"miscellaneous\" section of my compendium for now. I do hope to find more bread recipes for you, dear readers.\n This blackbread recipe is another I recommend for its taste and simplicity.\n Until next  , my friends.\n Yours as always,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n I have a confession to make. For the longest time, I thought that making drinking alcohol is something for a big tavern with a large basement or an overcomplicated factory in  . But I was wrong. With some help and a bit of guidance and trial-and-error, I present you my very first month-long attempt at making mead\u2014smaller quantities of course, and without fancy purification processes (I should ask a local   of   to do some purification for me next time), and without carbonation beyond a very slight natural fizz. And this attempt comes right in time for a two-year extravaganza celebration of this little project. Two years of trying, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding at replicating some of my favorite dishes found across   and beyond.\n This recipe is for the famous  , aptly named for the town of   that produces and ships it to some of the nearby cities, namely  , where you can try this libation in several taverns and inns or purchase a small cask to bring home from the  . Conyberry\u00a0is known for its harvest of wild berries found in abundance across the north and the   and for its wild  . All ingredients can be foraged in the town's vicinity as long as you avoid  's lair. All you need is water, wild  , wild honey, purified water, some   exported from the south, dried   berries and  . As all of the ingredients are either dried or non-perishable, the mead's production does not stop seasonally. It has a noticeably fruity hue produced by the spices and berries and a sweet, complex flavor. And it does not hurt that it packs so much alcohol even a   would need to take a nap after drinking just two dainty chalices. There are several combinations of flavors made in Conyberry, so do not worry if you see some sugarberry mead or mead flavored with herbs and apples brought over from the same town.\n Conyberry mead\n Makes about a gallon:\n Even though you can simply pile everything in a jar, mix it, and let it ferment, there are a few ways of making the process go smoother. Make sure the container you are using is cleaned thoroughly! Firstly, mix dried yeast with sugar and pour it on the bottom of the fermenting container. Then, add dried blueberries and juniper berries,   sticks,  , and   zest or slices if you want to give it a more exotic flavor.\n Bring a gallon of water to a boil in a pot. Turn the heat off and whisk four cups of honey into the water, making sure it fully dissolves. You do not have to do this step, but hot water will make the dissolving so much quicker. Let the honey water cool to a room or lukewarm temperature. This part is important: do not pour hot water into the yeast. The temperature will kill it! You could also add the berries or spices to the water to jumpstart the flavoring, but that is unnecessary.\n Carefully pour the cooled-down honey water into the fermenting jar over the yeast, sugar, berries, and spices. Use a tall skewer or a long spoon to stir the mixture, spread the yeast, and aerate the mixture.\n The next step is to seal. We want to protect the mead from any insects that might be attracted to it and have an airtight or almost airtight seal. If you do not have a dedicated valved cap used in fermenting, you can use a rubber bag and a food-grade rubber glove (make sure there is no powder on the gloves). Push the air out of a glove and stretch it over the neck of the fermenting jug. Wrap the glove's base and the jar's neck with a rubber band or a butcher's twine. Make sure it is as tight as possible. The inflated glove will mean the fermenting is in progress, and when it's deflated, you will know it's close to being done.\n Mark the container with the date \u2013 it is important to do if making more than one batch. Place the jar in a cool and dark place to ferment in peace. You should regularly check on the process. Might need to add more water in if you notice the level is dropping. The fermentation will take a month. First three weeks you will hear and see fizzing \u2013 this means the yeast is alive and feasting on sugars. About a week in, you will notice a deep color change, and the bottle will start getting cloudier. In three weeks, check on the jar. By that time, the fermentation is likely almost done, with just rare sporting bubbling going up, and you can see noticeable sediment on the fruit and the bottom of the jar \u2013 dead yeast.\n When a month had passed, and there was absolutely no more bubbling \u2013 its is time to strain and bottle. To strain, I pass the mead through a fine sieve, laid with several layers of cheesecloth first. Then, I leave the mead in a bottle for a couple of days \u2013 the leftover sediment will drop to the bottle's bottom. Now, you can either drink it or pass the mead through a paper coffee filter to have a clearer and prettier liquid. To bottle them, I use tallneck glass bottles with an airtight cork attached to the bottle by a metal lever frame.\n Chill the bottle and serve it to your guests. You will appreciate the refreshing sweetness and warming spice of the concoction. But we are wary my friends; the mead is sweet and packs a punch. Drink in moderation if you are a  .\n Sipping on home-made Conyberry mead is a great way to celebrate this project turning two years old. Here's to at least two years more!\n  and thank you for your patronage.\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met, dear readers. This  , we are returning to baking  . This recipe comes from something that is extremely rare on  \u2014the   of  , another world in a   far, far away. One notable kender,  , spent some years adventuring in   after meeting a group of friends of  , a deity and a friend of halflings. From   to Toril, he was content not to look for a way home for a long while, being around new friends. To quote the kender: \"Herb bread is good with little bits of\u00a0cheese\u00a0baked into it. Though not necessarily with\u00a0stew.\" At some point, Emilo was interviewed by the   of  , recounting his adventures and lore about his homeworld. An entire chapter in the book penned with Emilo's help was just various recipes from Krynn: kender dishes, as well as recipes from some famous place called the Inn of the Last Home. Saer Haversack was a lover of loaves, and this recipe of layered white bread comes flavored with butter, handfuls of  , big cubes of flavorful sharp   (surprisingly, found on many worlds across the vast  ). I find working with the bread dough for Emilo's recipe to be infinitely satisfying, thanks to layering, folding, rolling, and punching it down with cheese. And I found it makes a glorious   when generously soaked in eggs and cream and quickly fired for a morningfeast. Let's begin!\n Bread\nMakes one loaf:\n You will need to set aside about 3 hours from the beginning to the very end. Like with other breads made with  , begin by dissolving sugar and yeast in half a cup of lukewarm whole  . In a bowl, mix bread   and a pinch of  . Next, melt unsalted   in a bowl. Stir the yeast concoction and start mixing it with flour, one bit at a time. When about a cup of four is mixed, pour your melted butter in as well as half a tankard of warm water. Follow them up with the rest of the flour. You might need a few sprinkles of flour later as you are rolling the loaf.\n To develop the gluten, you will need to knead the dough for ten whole minutes, preferably by hand. Find a big bowl and grease it with a bit of olive oil to make removing the dough easier. Scoop the dough and transfer it into the greased bowl. Cover it with film and place it in a warm spot to rise. Leave it be for one hour to one and a half hours. We want to see it double in size.\n Filling & baking\nMakes one loaf:\n By now, the dough has doubled in size. Punch it down and remove it from the bowl. Roll the bread out flat, sprinkling the counter and the rolling pin with a bit of flour. You do not have to brush the layers with butter if you do not want your bread to be pulled apart on the layers. However I like that texture, making eating the bread fun. Use the previously warmed butter to make a thin layer of fat. Combine the finely chopped herbs in one bowl and mix them evenly. Sprinkle some of the herb mix over the butter. Then, press it down and fold it in two. Roll the dough flat once again and push some of the cheddar cubes into the dough. Fold and roll. Do not worry about breaking the dough; it is not particularly important. Continue buttering, sprinkling, and dotting the layers with cheddar until you use up all the ingredients.\n Lastly, fold the dough and press it into a rough loaf shape. Place it into a buttered and warmed-up bread loaf pan. Cover it and leave it to proof while the oven is pre-heating to 350F. You can play around with the loaf and twist it around to make the layering more fun. Let the bread rise for 30 minutes or so. The loaf should fill the pan well and start to rise out. Once the dough is fluffy and ready to go in, gently brush the top with just a touch of melted butter (you can use salted butter this time), and sprinkle the top with grated parmesan to give it a nice crust.\n Bake on the middle shelf at 350F for about fifty minutes. Depending on the oven, it might take a bit longer. If you take the bread out and it feels moist, pop it back for ten more minutes without the pan to make sure all sides are evenly baked.\n Emilo Haversack's herb and cheese bread tastes the best: freshly baked, still steaming, smothered with flavorful compound butter, or drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped tomatoes with salt and basil. As I mentioned before, it is a great bread to toast in butter or cook with eggs. A single slice would feel like a meal.\n And this is all for this tenday. Be warned, this bread goes fast!\n And for now,  .\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n This  's recipe is yet another type of alcoholic beverage. However, it is not as straightforward as what we've drank so far. This drink is called  . No, it is not a  , nor is it some sort of   sought after by   hoping to retire early. Firesword is a very common type of  . Not a specific drink but rather a somewhat diverse collection of amber   brewed in the towns of  ,\u00a0 , and\u00a0 . It is not the best location to visit if you are looking to sample Fireswords. Hillsfar is a non-visit place for  , thanks to the infamous 14  century   pogroms. Zhentil Keep is the ever-rebuilding and constantly raised home of the   \u2013 the dreaded   that deals in anything illegal and profitable. And Y\u00fblash, the once-ruined town that spawned the horrible   of  , oh so valorously defeated by the legendary   with some help from her sidekick   of the  .\n Similar ale recipes could also be found in the coastal lands of the   and even as far as the   but if you are stuck where I am, all you can find are ales, amber or otherwise, that have no living tiny fermenting creatures that, as some say, turn stuff into delicious alcohol. We do need them alive, as Firesword often is an \"inn standard.\" When an opened cask goes stale, Firesword is invigorated and revived with additional alcohol and honey, which, in turn, starts producing even more alcohol.\n We can simulate a similar flavor profile with several similar ingredients, turning it into a beer-based mixed drink. Prepare smallbites, and let us begin.\n Firesword\nMakes two small drinks or one large tankard:\n As with many other tavern libations, these drinks are easy to make. First, we need to decide on the flavor you prefer: Are we going to make it sweet and happy, or will it be more savory? Pale and white areas are closer in flavors to the original, but sweeter, more fruity, or   ales are options for those of us who like their drinks sweet. Honey liquors or   made with honey work as a substitute for rejuvenating the ale. On average, one and a half spoonfuls of wild honey add to the honey flavor, but with a more bitter-tasting ale, you can use two whole spoons, and a drizzle of orange will add to the drink's fruitiness.\n Mix honey and honey liqueur in a glass and whisk them together until they are thoroughly mixed. Prepare   tallglasses \u2013 place them in the ice box, and if you feel like deluding the drink a bit, prepare one or two large ice cubes per serving.\n Pour the ale into a chilled glass. Be careful and pour slowly at an angle to keep the foaming to a minimum. While everything is still cold, quickly pour in the honey and liquor mixture and stir once or twice. Add a single dash of  -flavored   and a light squeeze of orange juice (I used blood orange to give the drink that amber color). Another option to replace a squeeze of orange, place a slice of orange at the bottom of the tallglass and mash it with a spoon to release the juice, and only then top it with the ale.\n For garnish, use a slice of blood orange on a   toothpick. I tried sugaring the slice and caramelizing it with a blow torch, but the result was just not pretty. Sprinkling some   on the glass's rim did nothing for the flavor, so we are keeping decorations to a minimum.\n An entire tankard is a worthy drink, but if you want to appear as sophisticated as a   Queen, spill the drink into smaller decorated hand-cobbled glasses. I heard this peasanty simplicity is all the rage in Comyr's and  's courts.\n This is all I have for you this time. Next tenday, we will make a sauce from   and a bit of recipe testing over the weekday that might or might not involve  .\n Until next time,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Our culinary adventure brought us back to the City of Splendors,  , once again. And we are once again visiting the famous  . Every   in the   is familiar with the endless halls of   right underneath Waterdeep, with the mega-dungeon's entrance right at the center of the Yawning Portal's taproom. One of many legendary things a lucky, or rather unlucky, adventurer could find in the depths of the  's domain is the topic of today's recipe.   is an almost mythical and dangerous   that is meant to be the way of \"Mastering Death.\" Its recipe is famously engraved into the floor of a certain chamber deep in Undermaountain. Many   claimed that the recipe is incomplete and was left there specifically to entertain the Mad Mage's sadistic inclinations, as most of those who consumed the imperfect formula ended up dead, maimed, or damaged in terrifying ways.   himself, however, by many speculations, has discovered and consumed a perfect version of the Quaff. One person who attempted to create and consume Halaster's Quaff was a somewhat well-known   adventurer of eccentric habits, Finno Rawnpore of the   from the far-away  . Finno copied detailed instructions for the potion and paid off some   to brew the deadly concoction. To make the story short, he, or rather she, as she is now known, had her gender and sex magically changed. At the end of the day, this unforeseen change was welcomed by Finno. She embraced her new life as a woman, and for a short while, she was also convinced that the Quaff worked and granted her immortality. Needless to say, she was still just a mortal halfling and almost got killed in a misguided display of drunken bravado at the very taproom where the entrance into Undermountain stood. The last I heard of Lady Rawnpore, she was adventuring in the   as of  , trying to find the remnants of the infamous  .\n Nevertheless, that is enough about the potion. Ever-industrious,  , the proprietor of the Yawning Portal, put Halaster's Quaff on the menu. A mundane version, of course. He used  's description that the Quaff was dark in color and tasted like   and tasked his cooks with developing something adventurers would eagerly order. The end result of the hin cooks' work was a mug of delicious and rich   or   bone marrow stock, generously flavored with  ,  , and   mash. I highly recommend it as a slake or as a part of a highsunfeast.\n Bone marrow broth\n Makes four servings:\n This part is easy, and we have made stocks and broths before. Add all ingredients into a stewing pot and cover with water; four quarts should be more than enough. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat so the broth is simmering gently, cover, and leave to simmer for at least five hours. Make sure to regularly check the water levels and add more if needed. When simmering covered, leave a bit of a crack to make sure the temperature doesnt go too far. The marrow and bones will take a long time to cook and get all the flavor extracted, so plan accordingly. I ended up simmering my pot for closer to 9 hours.\n Now that the simmering is complete, we will need to strain the solids, discard them, and remove the excess fat from the broth. Use a fine sieve to strain the liquids into a big bowl. Discard the bones and vegetables and let the stock cool. We will place it in the cold box once it is not boiling hot. Chilling the broth fully will allow the fat to solidify, and you can easily spoon it out and throw it away to save it to be used as a powerful flavoring agent for another time. Fat freezes very well.\n The next step is not necessary, but this is a good opportunity to teach you how to clarify cloudy stocks.\n Clarified beef marrow stock\n The process of clarifying cloudy stock is messy and wasteful. It requires the use of very lean ground proteins, like chicken or turkey, or very lean beef or egg whites, all in high enough quantities to pull in all the impurities. Typically, if you are making poultry stock, use whites and turkey mince; if you are working with beef, use lean beef mince to keep the flavor strong. The lean proteins, in our case, egg whites will be mixed with julienned or very thinly sliced vegetables like  ,  , and   trimmings and cooked in the broth. This will allow the proteins to form a \"raft,\" with vegetables helping keep it in one piece. The proteins will absorb impurities, and you will end up with a nice-looking broth.\n As I mentioned, julienne the vegetables, separate egg whites, and reserve egg yolks for another culinary use at some point later. Beat the egg whites until they become cloudy, but we do not need to whip them into stiff peaks; we just want volume. Add vegetables to the whites, folding them in so that you do not deflate them.\n After you remove the solidified fat, pour the stock into a clean pot and heat it to a steady simmer. Spoon the whites and veggies mixture into the stock and stir it in. Classical clarification requires you to go in with your hand into a slightly cooled stock to mix the proteins into the liquid, but for our purposes, a big flat spoon would suffice. Stir the eggwhites and cover the pot to simmer. Make sure that the liquid doesnt boil or simmer too hard; it will break the eggs and ruin the raft. Check on the pot in ten minutes or so. If the eggwhites as still sticky, cover and cook for ten more.\n Once the raft is a solid cloud of eggwhites, turn the heat off and prepare to strain the stock. You will need a fine sieve that will catch any bits of egg that might escape the raft. Using a ladle, gently make an opening in the raft big enough for you to start taking out the broth through. One ladle at a time, transfer the stock from the pot into a bowl through the sieve, leaving eggs and vegetables behind.\n Now, we can finish the broth part and assemble the dish. Clean the soup pot and transfer the strained broth into it. Keep it hot. Taste and add salt to your liking. Be careful not to overseason it, as an entire pot will take a lot of salt. Lastly, you might notice the finest flakes of fat in the stock. There is a good way of removing it from the soup's surface. Rip paper towels or napkins into strips and drag them across the surface. The paper will catch the fat. Repeat it several times until the surface is as clean as you wish it to be.\n Condiments\n Halaster's Quaff is spooned into big tankards for a meal-sized serving or into small bowls for a smallbite serving. It is served piping hot, topped with a splash of lemon juice, fresh herbs, and a tiny spoonful of fresh ginger mash. On the side, it is served with pieces of cheese and hard bread to be dipped into or eaten with the Quaff.\n Lastly, a meal serving of Halaster's Quaff at the Yawning Portal comes with a bowl of fresh salads of  , sweet cherry  , shaved strong-flavored  ,  , and a drizzle of   and  , sprinkled with pepper flakes, black pepper, and sea salt.\n And thus concludes the  's recipe. Next, we will walk down the streets of Waterdeep and try more fried dough-clad handfoods.\n Until then,   my friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n As promised, this   I present you a recipe for  , a   staple of  , beloved by all the hin across  . Salbread is well-known among travelers who find themselves in Luiren, and similar recipes ended up being spread across the Realms through halflings and traveling merchants. The  , the guildhall of the\u00a0Waterdhavian guild\u00a0known as the  , adopted halfling salbread as their staple served to the guests as a part of their extremely limited grub menu. However, as you might've noticed, the House of Good Spirits uses a corruption of the original name and the recipe \u2013 \"saltbread\", as no halfling would willingly share a recipe, especially if it is a family recipe passed from one generation to the next. If a recipe survived the almost complete obliteration of Luiren during the  , it is worth protecting, I think. But if a cook tries to imitate or deconstruct the recipe by trying the  , it is fair game.\n One of the reasons why saltbread is popular is its longevity. Once baked, its crusty exterior keeps a loaf for several tendays, perfect for travel. As it is flavored with citrus, it is popular among sailors, helping them avoid  . Traditionally, salbread is baked in square pans for the ease of storing and transporting, but if you bake it to be served to the guests or a regional variety as found in  , the City of Splendors, other shapes are just as common. Its citrus flavor also makes salbread taste great with  ,  ,  , and topped with sweet and savory jams and jellies! I am using this recipe to make bread for two other recipes in this book: Good Spirits Saltbreads and the Western Heartlands Vegetable Broth. Let us begin!\n Salbread\n Makes one loaf\n We will begin by mixing a tankard of lukewarm water with   and  . Stir to dissolve sugar and let the yeast bloom and foam away. While the yeast is doing its magic, sift all-purpose flour into a mixing bowl. Add whole wheat flour, ground and dried   zest, sea salt, and white  . Mix or whisk the dry ingredients to evenly distribute all the ingredients.\n Once the yeast is foaming, start slowly pouring it into the dry ingredients and start working the dough. Sprinkle in two big spoonfuls of non-virgin   (however, other floral-tasting oils would work, too), and mix the dough. You might want to add a bit extra white flour to make the dough a bit easier to work with. Remember that it uses wheat flour, so the dough will be sticky. Knead the dough until it looks well incorporated, making sure there are no lumps. It should take about ten to twelve minutes of kneading.\n Lightly grease the dough ball with oil, cover the bowl, and let it rise for at least 12 hours in cold storage. The next day, take the dough out and let it come to room temperature in your warm kitchen. It should take about two hours. The dough will feel fluffier and lighter now.\n Preheat the oven to 450 F. While it is heating up, take the dough out from the bowl and cut the ball in two. Roll the two parts on a board, lightly dusted with flour, into two fat worm or slug-like loaves. Next, wrap the worms around eachother and curl them into a round shape.\n Grease the cast iron Dutch oven and gently transfer the loaf into it. Cover, and let the dough rise again for twenty minutes or so. Once the loaf is noticeably fluffed up, brush it with eggwash (an optional step as the whole wheat dough will darken well enough) and sprinkle it with large crystals of sea salt.\n Bake covered for thirty or thirty-five minutes in a preheated oven. As I stated above, whole wheat flour will darken quickly. Check the bread, and if it is crusty enough, gently flip it from the cast iron Dutch oven, transfer it onto a wire rack, and continue baking on it for twenty to twenty-five minutes more.\n The bread is ready once the crust is dark and tough. The best test is to flip the loaf over and tap on the bottom. If it produces a heavy and hollow sound, the bead is done.\n The salbread has a refreshing lemony taste that, in my oppinion, goes great as a light highsunfeast of  -smothered bread, topped with salt,  , and fresh   and  . Or used to make other dishes, like dicing the salbread into big pieces and smothering them in   and cheese as they do in The House of Good Spirits' kitchens, or served in broth like it is oh so common most anywhere in Faer\u00fbn.\n I recommend you try this bread for yourself. It's quite a treat.\n Now, I need to sip on my   soup, hydrate, and recover from a nasty bug. Until the next time, my friends,  \n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n \nGood tidings, my dear friends. Today, I bring you something more exotic than the usual Northern cuisine. We will take a short trip to the land of  ,  , and  . The northern land in the east bordered the dreaded country of the  . This drink is made with fermented   and has a very specific savory and yeasty flavor. It is called  , and at its core, the recipe is very similar to  , a soup found in   and  . Kvas in   is consumed warm and sugared. However, I prefer it chilled \u2013 it makes a great summer refresher sometimes with a wee bit of alcohol. The recipe is simple and can be drunk after a night of fermentation. The second part of today's recipe is something I call Rashemaar Summer Quaff. I have to admit I never caught the name of the dish when I traveled across the nation's villages with a certain famed author and master traveler. But this soup needs no cooking and has a refreshing taste of fresh vegetables and aromatic herbs. So let's begin!\n Kvas:  \n The most complex part of this recipe is finding a receptacle big enough to fit ten quarts of water and have a rim wide enough for us to be able to put the bread in. I used two oversized jars for this. Firstly, you will need one pound of   or dark rye  . The Rashemi cooks make a lot of kvas using stale hardened black bread \u2013 it is a great way of not wasting anything. If you do not have a pound of stale bread - we can make it ourselves. Chop the bread into smaller pieces and roast it in the oven on low until it is fully hardened. If it gets some color in the process, it is totally acceptable, but do not use anything that has been charred and blackened. It will ruin the taste! Alternatively, you could just leave the bread out, and it will get crusty in a day.\n You will also need a tankard full of   and, if you wish, half a tankard of some other dried fruits. They will not affect the taste much but will give the drink a nice fruity note. I used raisins and dried sweet   from the   as they are close to the cherries of Rashemen; however, the Rashemi cherries have stronger bitter notes.\n Split all the ingredients equally if you're making the recipe in several containers. Pour in one and a half heaping spoons of  , and add  . Fill the jars halfway with water and mix the yeast and sugar liquid to speed up the prices. Scoop in dried bread and dried fruit, and fill with the rest of the water.\n The fermentation will take 12 hours. Do not seal the jars; yeast needs air. The best way is to put cheesecloth on top and affix it in place with butcher's twine wrapped around the jars' neck. If you notice the water gets low \u2013 refill it with more fresh water. Remember that the bread and fruit will end up absorbing a good 20% of the water in the end.\n In the end, the liquid color will be golden or brownish and likely be clouded \u2013 it is exactly what we are looking for. Strain the kvas out through one or more layers of cheesecloth and a sieve and discard soggy bread. Make sure not to empty the jars completely, as the sediment will make the drink much more cloudy than it needs to be. Also, do not squeeze the soggy bread out \u2013 it will make kvas too cloudy too. But if you don't care bout the color \u2013 the best way to extract the liquid is through a triple filter and let it just drip.\n The resulting drink can stay in a cool spot for almost a  . Seven days or so. There are several ways of drinking it. The Rashemi way \u2013 warm morning drink with a sprinkle of sugar. Chilled summer drink by itself, honeyed or sugared, or with a pinch of sugar mashed together with mint and served in a tankard of chilled kvas.\n Soup (2 servings):\n This fresh summer soup will need cooking and can be done in a rush. Rashemaar Summer Quaff just needs several handfuls of meats and vegetables. The Rashemi way to so use  , roasted, dried   or  . The best option here in the north is venison sausage, dry if possible. If you are using salted meat \u2013 you will need to soak it in water to remove excess salt. Boil potatoes and eggs. Potatoes will take about 40 minutes, and ten minutes for  's eggs. All ingredients will be chilled and diced. We will also dice  ,  , and finely chop herbs such as   and  .\n To plate, arrange the diced ingredients in an esthetically pleasing manner. Pile herbs in the middle and pour in kvas. Add salt and   to taste, and scoop two spoons of   into the soup. Stir and sprinkle thinly sliced habanero peppers to add a bit of zest. Serve with a tankard of kvas.\n This tenday's recipe was different and required no cooking. The next recipe will not be such. We will be dusting things with sugar,   way!\n That would be all, my friends. We will return to Rashemen one day, but for now,  , and until we cook together again!\n Yours truly,\nJuniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met my dear friends, old and new. This   we are returning to  , The Land Beneath the Dales and its glittering capital \u2013  . Those who ever visited the city's   know that the name might be a bit misleading. It was not a place of luxurious embassies and fancy shops dealing in exotic goods. It is a district of workers and laborers known for rowdy taverns frequented by simple folk, adventurers, and traders.  , or as I call it, Sembian meatbread, is a cheap dish that can often be found there.\n There were cheaply made meatbreads, loaves of   filled with mincemeat, and slaughterhouse discards, all  ,  , and all boiled and chopped. The recipe you can find in wealthier areas, among those who can afford better cuts of meat, Sembian meatbread was made with spiced mincemeat,  ,  , and sharp cheese.\n Bread dough (2 loaves):\n We've made similar dough before, so I will be brief. Mix warm   and water with   and   and let it bloom. Once the yeast begins to foam, mix it with room-temperature yogurt and gradually start adding flour and salt, kneading the dough until it feels smooth; about 8 minutes should do. Sprinkle the dough with oil and rub it all over, cover, and let it proof for 2 hours in a warm room.\n Stuffing (2 loaves):\n Start by browning the mincemeat. You don't need to cook it thoroughly, but you need to render the fat. Mix all dry spices with the meat as you fry it up. The authentic recipe calls for using the rendered fat as a thickener, so we will not be draining it. Instead, scoop the meat out and reserve it for later. On medium heat, toss finely chopped vegetables into the rendered fat and cook it all, regularly stirring, until the vegetables darken in color and become soft. Add half a spoon of flour if the fat is not absorbed into the vegetables. Mix well, remove from heat, and stir into the meat and add chopped fresh dill. Grate sharp aged cheddar into a separate bowl. \n Now, we will return to the dough. Punch it down to deflate it and separate it into two even portions. Using a floured board and rolling pin, flatten each piece into a circle. Place half a tankard of shredded cheese at the center in a circle. Top it with half of the meat and vegetable mix. Bush the edges with water or eggwash. Fold each side, one at a time, and gently press them together. Flip the loaf and transfer it into a greased (optionally) cast iron Dutch oven. Brush the top with eggwash and sprinkle it with cheese.\n We will be baking the bread in a well-preheated oven at 400F. For the first twenty-five minutes, bake it whilst covered, then remove the cover and bake for twenty-five minutes more. When the bread is ready, it will feel hard and crusty.\n Now, all you need to do is to cill the bread and slice it to serve. In Sembia, a loaf of unsliced meatbread would last one or two days and still be sold at eateries and drinking holes. Stale meatbread can be reheated and smothered in butter to return it to its softness. I served a slice of meatbread with a plateful of  , feta, and almonds, drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice with a dash of pepper and salt.\n This is all I have for you this day. Next tenday's recipe will be another fruit sauce and what you can make with it!\n Until next time, \n , my friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Another short entry in our culinary journey across   comes to you this  , despite that the process of making it was almost two whole months. You might've already guessed that we will be talking about  .   is the fermented drink in question. You might be surprised to know that it is not just for the  . Depending on the species of   used, wine made from them is found in quite a few places on the surface. And yes, if you might raise an eyebrow reading this, mushroom wine is indeed an acquired taste but not unpleasant. Not all mushrooms can be fermented on their own; some lack the natural   that is needed for fermentation, while others need a bit of a kick from other ingredients, both in an alchemical and savory sense. Typically, mushroom wine is either purplish in color or a gorgeous hue of clear amber.\n The most famous variety of mushroom wine (thanks to saer  ) is made in the town of   from a unique species of mushrooms only found there. Another place where you can try it is the village of  , which uses yet another species of unique mushrooms. Inns and taverns in   always have access to more common varieties, and some of the most expensive and delicate vintages date back all the way to the era of  .   mushroom wines tend to be stronger and more flavorful than those produced by  ,  , and  . And halflings making mushroom wine is almost unheard of, likely because we prefer our drinks sweeter or more potent.\n This recipe is not from yours truly but from a wise sage who is known for his creation of \"Very Good Drinks.\" With his help, I was able to do what I like to call the closest imitation of the great Myth Drannan elvish mushroom wines one can make in their own kitchen. The recipe calls for certain mushrooms found in  , but we can substitute them for something just as savory and locally available from most greengrocers. We will also use black   and   to aid with fermentation as on their own, the mushrooms we are using lack yeast. Note that this recipe will take quite some time to be ready for consumption.\n Mushroom wine\n Makes around half a gallon:\n The process of preparing the ingredients for fermentation is simple. When I prepared my mushroom wine, I doubled the recipe just to fill an oversized gallon jug. Additionally, I increased the amount of sugar and mushrooms to both increase the alcohol content and get more of the fun fungi flavor in.\n Begin by brewing a full cup of strong Earl Gray tea; use about two teabags for half a gallon of wine. Let the tea steep in hot water until the liquid comes down to a lukewarm temperature. Do not add hot tea to the fermentation jug, or it will kill all the yeast.\tWhile the teal is cooling, brush your fresh shiitake mushrooms off of any soil and dirt, slice off the root, and roughly cut into big chunks. Mix two cups of   with chopped mushrooms and let them macerate for at least an hour in sugar. This is an important step for the flavor.\n You will also need to use purple grapes. Use only grapes with seeds, preferably from your local farmers' market. We need grapes and their natural yeast. Only wash the grapes if they are horribly soiled. Crush grapes with your hands, enough to fill a cup. Reserve seeds, pulp, and juice for the fermentation. You should use your ungloved hands to do the mushing unless your hands are contaminated by anything harmful or dirty.\n Use a thoroughly cleaned fermenting container and transfer all the ingredients, including distilled water, into it. Whisk or vigorously stir the mixture to dissolve the sugar and aerate the liquid.\n Seal the fermenting container in a similar fashion as we did with mead. Use a rubber glove on the neck and tightly affix it in place with a butcher's twine as tight as humanly possible. Mark the container with the date \u2013 it is important to do if making more than one batch. Place the jar in a cool and dark place to ferment in peace. You should regularly check on the process. Might need to add more water in if you notice the level is dropping. The fermentation will take a month. But the first step will take just under a week: 5 or six days. You should notice that the wine is bubbling \u2013 this means the yeast is alive and is consuming the sugar. If you are doubling the recipe, the first initial fermentation step will take a bit longer, around 9 days. Once it's time, carefully strain the solids out of the wine using a clean sieve and transfer them into a clean container with an airtight seal.\n Check back in a week and a half\u2014the fermentation should still be going. You might notice a buildup of yeast on top of the liquid. Continue fermenting the liquid until you reach a month's time. Now it is time to strain the wine once again and bottle it in airtight bottles to be aged.\n The flavor after a month will be rough and aggressive, but that is why we need to age the bottled wine for three more weeks. If you store the bottles upright in a cool area, you will see that the wine is now clear as all the dead yeast and sediment fell to the bottom, leaving behind a beautiful and clear amber liquid. The wine is ready to be consumed.\n Mushroom wine is an acquired taste, as stated by the Master Traveler  . It has noticeable earthy notes, taste, and alcohol content of young green wine with a slight flavor of   that we've made before, which is not surprising knowing the ingredients we used. Despite its specific taste, it is a refreshing drink that would be especially popular among subterranean races and the   alike.\n Even though the celebration of   is in full swing as we speak, a jug of mushroom wine would be welcomed at any table. It is especially good for the festival's customary stargazing picnics (but if you are planning on stargazing somewhere in the north, bring some hot buttered rum drinks \u2013 the recipe to come, or spiced ciders).\n Until next time,\n Your friend, \n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Good tidings, my friends. We are back on the topic of bread this  . For something as simple as   with  ,   is surprisingly rare. I've come across it once in  , where they served huge loaves of sweet bread stuffed with sugar. Another example came from  .   inn in   baked fresh sugarbread and, while it is still hot, smothered in sweet   and  . A simple but satisfying dessert. Very rustic.\n We will make the bread today, which by itself is a bit of work. We will later use its leftovers to make a couple of types of   from two places across the continent from each other.\n Bread:\n This bread takes a bit of time. We will begin by soaking rolled   in milk to soften it. You can soak it overnight in 2 tankards of cold milk or cook it simmering on low heat in a pot for 15-20 minutes until the berries are soft. Before working on the dough, you will need to bloom the yeast with a pinch of sugar at room temperature or lukewarm milk - 1/4 tankard that's left from barley.\n Mix all dry ingredients in a bread maker or in a large bowl. You don't need to sift flour, but I recommend that you do so with white flour, leaving whole wheat on the bottom. Add the sugar. If you like your bread sweeter\u2013double it. Start pouring in your barley milk and yeast, small quantities at a time. Do not add hot milk. If you cooked barley, chill before mixing. Hot liquid will kill the yeast, and the bread will not rise.\n This is a glutinous bread, so it will require a lot of kneading. It took me about 15 minutes to work on the dough by hand to achieve the desired texture and picture. You will know that the gluten is developed enough when you can stretch the dough without it ripping and its surface is smooth.\n Stuffing:\n Lightly oil your hands, rub the bread's surface, and leave to rise in a warm place, covered, for about 40 minutes. It will double in size. Next, transfer it to a large, flat working surface, lightly dusted with flour. Roll the entire clump of dough flat. Don't worry about its shape. Now, we will make layers of   and sugar. I picked a method to sprinkle cubes of butter to create pockets and a light amount of sugar, as I prefer less sweetness in beads, pictured to the right. For you, I would recommend you double the amount of butter and sugar you see in the picture. Press it into the dough and fold in two. Roll the dough thin, but press down gently to avoid breaking it. Add butter and sugar. Repeat it at least two more times. Do not be afraid to get messy \u2013 'tis inevitable!\n On the last layer, gently but tightly roll it into a long sausage-like tube, pressing the seams down to seal them. Roll the dough tube into a spiral, puck the outer end of it under the loaf, and transfer it into a lightly greased cast iron Dutch oven. It does not have to be pre-heated. Cover it with a towel and start pre-heating the oven to 400F.\n The bread will rise again, doubling in size after 30 minutes or so. Cover with the dutch oven top and place to bake. Bake for 40 minutes, then remove the color and test the bread. A cake tester inserted in the seam should come out clean. Test by knocking on the crust and doing a press test. The bread should not sink under pressure but spring back, showing resistance.\n Let it cool well enough to handle and cut or rip into cubes. The Vast's inn served it in a bowl where the bread was put to soak brandy in, slowly replacing its moisture with alcohol. You, on the other hand, can do that with stale bread. Fresh simply needs a drizzle enough on each piece to flavor it. Top it with cream whipped with a bit of   and confectioner's sugar for sweetness. I also added some preserved   on top and reduced peach juice into syrup with a dash of brandy, pouring it on top of the entire dish.\n This is all you need to know to make your own sugarbread. In places where fanciful pastry and sugared confections are rare, folk still want to treat themselves to something sweet at the end of a long day. And, of course, a good dose of  , or even   from the   make the evening feasts finale even more pleasant.\n But this is not all! We are going to reserve some of the sugarbread and let it get stale. Two versions of bead pudding are to come: one from the   in  , and the other \u2013 from  , in  .\n Until then,  . We will cook together again soon.\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Happy  , my friends! Now that I do not feel like dying or being consumed by the  , we can return to eating! In this case \u2013 drinking. I know us halflings like sweet things or things with a lot of potency, but we will try to make something from the  's repertoire.\n This  -like \"soup\" is a tangy, spiced, yet refreshing drink made with several types of barks and plants. It is steeped to make a bitter concentrate that later is mixed with water, syrup, juice, and alcohol, served sweetened by tree gum, sugar, and forest berries. Getting authentic ingredients for what I humbly named \"  forest slake\" is virtually impossible if you are not in the Tangled Trees yourself. I came up with some locally available ingredients, even though you might want to visit   to get your hands on this specific type of gum, bark, and root.\n For steeping (makes 1/2 gallon):\n Serving:\n If you successfully found some snow swallow gum, before we can use it, it has to be rehydrated. Put half a tankard of tree gum into a bowl, add syrup or sugar, and cover with cold water. Stir to dissolve the sweetener and top with more cold water so the level is 1/3 volume above the gum. Leave it to rehydrate for about a day before serving. Make sure to top with water if the gum becomes uncovered.\n The next step is the easiest one. Place dried mauby bark piece, sarsaparilla root,   sticks, star  ,  ,   peel, thinly sliced  ,  , and dried   in a simmer pot along with a gallon of drinking water. You do not want to have much white in the orange peel; the resulting liquid will be bitter enough. Turn the heat to the max and bring to a rolling boil. If you want to add sugar now, it will take in about half a cup of white sugar. I personally prefer adding sugar to the glass before serving. Reduce the heat and let the liquid simmer on low heat for 40 minutes.\n Turn the heat off and strain the steeped liquid through a strainer lined with cheesecloth. Discard the bits and let the liquid chill until thoroughly cooled. I used a large bottle with a wide neck. This liquid will hold for over a month, ready to be consumed. Undiluted slake will be brownish in color and will be pleasant grayish yellow when mixed into a drink. \n This \"soup\" is served in wide-brim bowls by   with berries and gum floating in it as an appetizer or a refresher. However, I think we can do better by making it into a chilled summer drink. One serving will be a single cup. To make Tangled Trees forest slake, use a single ounce of the steeping liquid. Be wary \u2013 it is bitter on its own, and you might want to adjust the water\u2013concentrate ratio. In a cocktail shaker or in a bowl with a whisk, mix together an ounce of the drink, a splash of lemon juice, a big spoon of sugar, and about a tankard of water. Once the sugar is gone, pour it into the serving vessel \u2013 a tall glass with ice,  ,  ,   balls, and two spoonfuls of sweetened and soaked tree gum.\n My favorite way of sipping on this pleasant spiced and herbal slake is using half a tankard of water to mix, transferring it all into the cup, and then topping it with fresh sparkling water. When preparing the tallglass, try to make it appealing visually, make layers of ice, berries, and gum crystals, and only then carefully pour the drink in. You have to use lemon juice to add a bit of gentle acidity to it, but a squeeze of orange juice in addition can work well. It tastes perfect on its own, but you can also make it into an adult's libation. \n To make an adult version, substitute sugar for syrup, preferably flavorless, and add 2 ounces of a clear, tasteless alcoholic drink to it, like   (vodka), blend together with lemon juice to adjust the taste and pour into a tall iced glass, topping it with sparkling water.\n This  's recipe was interesting as we actually cooked nothing and basically just mixed tea! Elven quaff is reimagined as a refreshing, sweet, savory, a bit tangy, and a gently spiced drink. I hope you can track down the ingredients and try this one for yourself. Alternatively, you could turn this drink into a concentrate and freeze to use at a later date; otherwise all you need is trees and water. I have another elven drink for you, but we will have to make it another day.\n As always, thank you for reading this, my friends.   and until next time.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n We, the  , know the best places and the best strong and fruity drinks across the Realms. If you see a halfling behind a bar pouring drinks together, you are likely to get something special.   is an old manyslake, once recommended to me by the famous hin   hero  , and we will talk about it next. But for now, while it is still cold out, turn your eyes to the Yeti's Breath's polar opposite: Tapdragon's Breath. Just like Yeti's, the drink's base is still  , a clear hard liquor distilled from   and  . It packs a wallop and is named after a   for its fiery alcohol content. The beverage is close to   or clear sugar cane  , but for this cocktail, sugar cane rum is the only substitute.   or caramel-colored rum would work too, but make sure to avoid spiced variations as we will spice the manyslake plenty. The origins of Tapdragon's Breath are not clear. You can find the drink in  ,  , the northwest  , and some big cities in the North, like  , but it is also still immensely popular as a seasonal libation in  , the Silver Marches, even found in roadside inns alongside cheaper and ever-popular   and  .\n I suspect it was created as a simpler alternative for other heavily spiced dairy drinks, but the creator had nothing but salted butter on hand and had to improvise. My version has a small deviation from the tradition: a light splash of whipping   that adds flavor to the melted butter. The advice came from the   in the  . Its proprietress,  , also supplied me with a small batch of Tapdragon back in the day. However, I am unsure if the Moonwyvern still produces it. But Clarshee's batch had a delightful hint of   and a very wispy, light, smoky flavor. Shall we warm our bones now with two tankards of Tapdragon's Breath?\n Tapdragon's Breath\n Makes two servings:\n Set your kettle on fire, and while it gets to a boil, warm up cold butter. You can leave it out of the cold storage for some time, and will will soften naturally, or cover your butter receptacle with a metal bowl after heating the bowl up with boiling water. The original recipe called for lightly salted butter; in that case, 4 big spoonfuls will be enough for 2 drinks, but if you dont want to add salt to the sugar, use five big spoonfuls of unsalted sweet cream butter.\n When the butter is soft, cream it in a bowl with the sugar, using a rubber spatula or a whisk. Once incorporated, add  , ground  ,  , and  . Add a splash of boiling water and whisk it all together into a dark paste. Scoop the paste into two 16-ounce copper tankards.\n Slice fresh   rind off the fruit and stick the rind with cloves. Pierce the rind onto cocktail toothpicks to decorate and use as a stir.\n Pour a shot (or two if you're getting ready to sing a ballad at a tavern tonight) of Tapdragon into the tankards and top them with hot water, as well as a tiny splash of cream. Stir to fully dissolve butter and sugar. Now, all you need is to toss a star anise pot and a cinnamon stick into the mug and top it with the rind on a cocktail stick.\n A perfect winter drink for your enjoyment. Feel free to replace lemon rind with orange or with candied peel or even whole dried candied citrus slices!\n Next tenday, we will wrangle down some  's for their breath! And after that we will return to Cormyr for some delectable little tartlets.\n Until next time,  \n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n I am fairly sure that the bartender at the   of   is a   \u2013 the only explanation for the drinks menu and their odd names. This drink is yet another offering from the same establishment, a strange concoction of  ,  , and   flavors. The Moon's Head Brace is a mixed drink, usually white in color, had a   flavor, and left the imbiber's head spinning from intoxication. According to a story I heard from the same olf fella,  , the drink was designed to taste of  , popular among the  , its color was to venerate the goddess \u2013 The Moonmaiden, and it was named after a weapon called  , because when humans imbibed the drink, the reportedly felt like they were clobbered by one of these Sel\u00fbnite bludgeons, not because how one needed to brace themselves. But either of the stories behind the drink is romanticized enough to satisfy a curious theatergoer, and it is strong enough to help you forget the hollering folk on stage.\n I've made some adjustments to the drink to satisfy a palette of non- . Mushroom might be a pleasant flavor, but by itself, it can taste like dirty   silt. Also, by adding   to the drink, we change its taste and color to appear more muddy, but the white foam is still there on the top of the glass to remind you of the original recipe. Of course, there are several ways of adding a kick to the drink, for example, using a bit of   liquor or one of those fanciful   or   alcoholic beverages oh so popular among dowagers of  .\n The Moon's Head Brace\nMakes one serving:\n Firstly, let's talk about making mushroom kaeth. There are special powdered mixes of various mushrooms that could be used for this drink, like Lion's Mane, Turkey Tail, or Reishi, for their thick, bitter, and sweet taste. But we can use more common dried mushrooms as well as more exotic fungi. Miitaki and porcini are commonly available and often come dried and packed for your convenience, like mushroom packages from  . I chose to turn my mushrooms into a powder and mix it with coffee to brew in a French press and a second batch \u2013 in an espresso pump.\n The easiest way is the French press, the coffee ground steeped with powdered, crushed, or chopped dried mushrooms. Make strong coffee as you would normally do, 4.5 tablespoons, and add two tablespoons of mushrooms and two cups of boiling water. Steep the coffee, strain it, and chill it in an ice box.\n Scrape vanilla bean and add the bean and pulp to coconut milk or almond milk. Warm it up to infuse the flavor, add one teaspoon of maple syrup, and dissolve. Let it simmer for a few minutes and let it sit on the stove to cool. Do not forget to take out the bean before mixing the drink.\n Whip together coconut butter with a dash of water and a teaspoon of maple syrup until it turns fluffy. Use a chilled cocktail shaker and one or two huge ice cubes. Combine cooled mushroom coffee,  , and  . Do a quick single shake and pour it into a chilled glass. Spoon whipped coconut foam on top and sprinkle it with shredded   flakes.\n A simple recipe, but I found that in order to avoid a burned or watery taste, you need to use quality coffee, preferably from  . The watery taste can be remedied by mixing 1:1 of coconut or almond milk with coconut rum or cream liqueur, but be mindful of sweetness. Using coconut rum or cream liqueur would mean you have to leave a teaspoon of maple syrup out of steeping milk with vanilla.\n A quick recipe for a Ravenaar drink. Next tenday we will likely be taking a break for travel to the splendorous  ! But there are still many recipes to come!\n  and until next time,\n Your friend,\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n Well met friends. This  , we are attempting something new for this strange culinary little project of ours. The   of  , a theater built by and dedicated to  , She Who Guides, Our Lady of Silver, the Moonmaiden. It is a younger establishment, less reputable than its older sibling- the  , and, believe it or not, was established by a group of fellow adventurers, who, not surprisingly, venerated the Moonmaiden. Originally, the famed Knight Commander of the   and Knight of the     was its main sponsor, and the theater is still connected to the Darkarrow estate. The theater is being advertised as a stage that holds masterful and tasteful plays, operas, and other performances by  , musicians, actors, contortionists, dancers, and  . But we are not here to talk about performance art,  \n The Silvermoon Playhouse offers a small selection of drinks at the bar to the theatergoers, and when the troupes are on the seasonal breaks, the bar is open as a tavern for the Ravenaar. I visited it back when it was in its twelfth production. The show in question was a   comedy play called  . Long story short \u2013 I was praising   the theater served nearly unlimited alcohol. And it was well needed to make the performance tolerable. One of the drinks served was called  , named as such due to its sheer strength. \"Have two or three, and you will swear that chair was walked from under you!\" they promised. A mug of that concoction was just what I needed to make this show of humans bellowing at the top of their lungs tolerable.\n The Walking Furniture (makes one big serving):\n The drink is served in huge iced   tankards filled with large carved chunks of ice with a simple garnish of a slice of  .\n To make the drink, you will need a single full twelve-ounce tankard of hard  , well chilled.   is what they used at the Silvermoon Playhouse, but I've made it with non-alcoholic apple cider when I want less strength in the drink, and when I want to taste  , I make the drink with hard   cider.\n Fill a cocktail shaker with large chunks of ice, add a shot of dark spiced  , like  , two shots of clear hard alcohol, like   or  , half-a-shot of heavily  -flavored liquor (triple sec),  and half-a-shot of heavily-flavored   liquor, like St. Elizabeth Allspice Dreams. Shake the drink well and strain it into a tall tankard filled with huge cubes of ice. Tilt the tankard and pour cider into the drink.\n Squeeze a piece of lemon rind onto the drink to spray a bit of lemon oil into the drink and garnish with a twist of lemon and/or a thin slice of lemon.\n This mixed libation is not very sweet; the only sugar is from the cider, so plan your drinking accordingly. Using something like amber cider will result in an almost savory drink while using pineapple cider will give you a sweet libation that can satisfy most hin.\n Whether I ended up experiencing the said \"furniture walking from under me\" shall remain a story untold unless you buy me a tankard of The Walking Furniture and ask nicely.\n This is all I have for you this tenday. A short recipe for a mixed drink. And a few more to come. This weekend, we will make some halfling buns. I can not wait!\n Until then,   my friends.\n Juniper Churlgo\n \n \n The last time we prepared a tavern  , Tapdragon's Breath, I mentioned that in its mouthfeel and inspiration it is a polar (har har) opposite of Yeti's Breath. It's a libation made of simple ingredients that one might find substitutes for in less-fanciful dockside drinking holes. One place where you could try it adequately prepared is  , the capital of  , the Forest Kingdom of central Faer\u00fbn.  , where the famed sellsword   once stayed, is where I tried it for the first time. However, I had to ask someone else to order it as, at the time, the inn's management treated me with suspicion and annoyance, after shooing me away from the kitchen seven times in two days. Mark the inn down as yet another establishment where they guard the secrets of cookery like  . To no one's surprise, the drink is named after the terrifying species of arctic monkey-things,  , that are known for their foul attitudes, aggressive behavior, grunting barking language, and lovely white fur that can stave off the fiercest of  's blizzards. Some of them can even release a deadly breath of freezing magic like an ice dragon, or so some adventurers have claimed. And the drink lives up to the northern beast.\n It is not just served in a tallglass of crushed ice, but it is also flavored with  ,  , and  . Darsargar is simply what they use in areas where fresh ginger is unavailable. It is dried, ground, and powdered root of the ginger plant. I do like using an inch of fresh ginger for the drink, ground through a Microplane with pulp and juices reserved. The use of tapdragon is the same as what we did for Tapdragon's Breath, a strong alcoholic drink distilled from  ; using brown-colored is fine, but if you prefer a more crystalline look, go with a clear-colored variety. Lastly, menthol, made out of the   plant, can be added with home-infused menthol   (or vodka), but a good alternative is menthol schnapps.\n I have seen clear variants of the drink served in Cormyr, but also, towards the  , sweeter and colored variants are popular, usually flavored with sugar syrup, some blue or azure-colored liquors, or even with some glitter stirred in to make it look like a blizzard. Of course, I suggest you experiment with the drink to find a good combination to your liking. Let's start shaking that manyslake, friends.\n Tapdragon's Breath\n Makes one serving:\n Begin by crushing the ice. We will need enough to fill a tallglass almost most of the way through. Chill the glass and crushed ice in them. Keep them frozen until ready to serve. Chill the shaker and prepare several big chunks of ice to shake the drink with. Note that the pictures feature several attempts at Yeti's Breath. Cubes of ice would work, but crushed ice will freeze condensation on the glass, giving it a truly wintery feel once served.\n Peel an inch of fresh ginger and push it through a powerful garlic press or grate it with a Microplane. We want the mash of the fibers and juice.\n Combine the two parts of sugarcane rum, one part of mentholmint schnapps, the entire serving of prepared ginger mash, and a spoonful of simple syrup (you might want to add two if you have a hin's sweet tooth) in a chilled cocktail shaker with several cubes of ice inside. Give a few solid shakes and pour over a tall glass of crushed ice.\n Fill the rest of the space with ice-cold ginger ale, leaving just enough space for a tablespoon on top. Mix half a small spoon of bright Blue Curacao with a light drizzle of simple syrup and about two big spoons of ginger ale. Stir and gently pour it over the drink to make it blue on top and get darker towards the bottom. If you do not like the yellowish color, substitute sugarcane rum for a clear variety.\n The drink is to be served with a straw, decorated with a slice of ginger, a bit of candied ginger skewered on a toothpick, and/or a sprig of mint. The glass will quickly ice over on the outside, completing the presentation.\n Play with the amount of Blue Curacao you want to use in the drink. One spoonful produces a bright electric blue, and about half a teaspoon has just enough color, but only if you dilute it with something light or colorless.\n One substitution to consider is clear mint liquor instead of mentholmint; it is easier to find but lacks that mouth-chill of menthol. Another option is to infuse your own quart of vodka, enough to serve a handful of drinks, but it needs to be done days ahead, if not weeks.\n That's all this tenday \u2013 yet another short entry. Next time, we will be making a pie from   and trying to sear some fish! \n Until then,  , friends.\n Juniper Churlgo.\n \n \n", "url": "https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/User:Artyom.pavlov/Characters/Juniper_Churlgo/Juniper%27s_Companion_to_Venturesome_Cookery"},
